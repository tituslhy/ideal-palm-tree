(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles.

Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p.

Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Table 11: Correlation between views and new jobs\nDependent variable:\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nNew job 0.513 \u2217\u2217\u2217 0.400\u2217\u2217\u2217 0.497\u2217\u2217\u2217 0.379\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.008) (0.007) (0.007) (0.006)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nR2 0.109 0.090 0.107 0.086\nAdjusted R2 0.109 0.090 0.107 0.086\nResidual Std.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Figure 3: Conditional Local Average Treatment Effects\nNote: Estimates of the Local Average Treatment Effects of sharing the credential conditional on the baseline level of employability.\nEstimates from models estimated with data on learners with an increasing baseline employability.\nA8", "Table 9: Covariate balance between treatment and control\nVariable Mean Difference Standard Error Treatment Mean Control Mean Treatment N Control N\nfirst_skill_score_1 3e-04 0.0014 0.1002 0.0999 381815 383801\nfirst_skill_score_3 0 1e-04 0 0 381815 383801\nassociate_degree 3e-04 4e-04 0.029 0.0287 381815 383801\nbachelor_degree -8e-04 8e-04 0.1269 0.1278 381815 383801\nsome_college -5e-04 6e-04 0.0721 0.0726 381815 383801\ndoctorate_degree -2e-04 2e-04 0.0043 0.0045 381815 383801\nhigh_school_diploma -4e-04 5e-04 0.0592 0.0596 381815 383801\nless_than_high_school 0 2e-04 0.0089 0.009 381815 383801\nmasters_degree -7e-04 5e-04 0.0496 0.0503 381815 383801\nno_education_mentioned 0.0022 0.0011 0.6458 0.6436 381815 383801\nprofessional_degree 2e-04 1e-04 0.0041 0.0038 381815 383801\nmale -8e-04 0.001 0.3014 0.3022 381815 383801\ngender_not_mentioned 9e-04 0.0011 0.5336 0.5328 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_computer_science 0.0015 0.001 0.2529 0.2514 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_data_science -0.001 0.001 0.2353 0.2363 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_information_technology -6e-04 8e-04 0.1398 0.1404 381815 383801\ncredential_type_guided_project 1e-04 9e-04 0.1679 0.1678 381815 383801\ncredential_type_professional_certificate -1e-04 2e-04 0.0054 0.0055 381815 383801\ncredential_type_specialization -3e-04 2e-04 0.0084 0.0087 381815 383801\ndeveloping_country 5e-04 7e-04 0.8962 0.8957 381815 383801\nprofessional_exp_years 0.0464 0.0609 3.6122 3.5658 18487 18459\npast_business_job -0.0014 0.0026 0.0641 0.0655 18487 18459\npast_tech_job 0.0034 0.0035 0.1308 0.1274 18487 18459\nNote: Averages of covariate values across treatment and control groups.\nC Impact of Credential Feature on Credential Sharing\nPanel A of Table 10 presents the average treatment effect estimates on credential sharing per batch.

Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope .

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group.

The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%.

Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups).

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables.

We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app.", "Table 3: Impact of Credential Feature on combined Credential Shareed and New Job indicators\nModel 1 Model 2\nNew Job No new job New Job New Job No new job New Job\nNo certificate Certificate Certificate No certificate Certificate Certificate\nCredential Feature 0.034 0.050 0.116 \u22120.071 \u22120.002 \u22120.035\n(0.041) (0.027) (0.034) (0.053) (0.038) (0.044)\nLow employability \u22121.113 \u22120.513 \u22121.245\n(0.063) (0.039) (0.054)\nCredential Feature * Low employability 0.266 0.098 0.415\n(0.087) (0.054) (0.073)\nBaseline 0.0696 0.193 0.103 0.0696 0.193 0.103\n(0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022) (0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nNote: Multinomial logistic regression with outcome variable equal to the group indicator.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Estimates based on the LinkedIn\nMatched Sample.\nE Local average treatment effect across deciles\nTo analyze the impact of Credential Shared across various levels of employability as predicted by our\nmodels, we predict baseline employability using a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with cross-\nfitting on a LinkedIn Matched Sample. The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "The study suggests that prioritizing access to the Credential Feature for learners with lower baseline employability can be advantageous because it is associated with better outcomes among this group.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all. Hadavand et al. (2018) compared outcomes of completers to non-completers of a large\n4", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "1 Introduction\nIn today\u2019s educational landscape, non-traditional credentials, frequently acquired through online courses,\nhave become increasingly popular. In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"], "response": "Based on the provided context information, the research suggests that MOOC credentials can have a positive impact on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes.

We notice that each batch followed a similar trend in reporting new jobs, with\napproximately 10% of learners reporting a new job after six months. In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job. Solid lines\ntreatment groups. Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "K\u00e4ssi, O. and Lehdonvirta, V .

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Table 11: Correlation between views and new jobs\nDependent variable:\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nNew job 0.513 \u2217\u2217\u2217 0.400\u2217\u2217\u2217 0.497\u2217\u2217\u2217 0.379\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.008) (0.007) (0.007) (0.006)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nR2 0.109 0.090 0.107 0.086\nAdjusted R2 0.109 0.090 0.107 0.086\nResidual Std.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Figure 3: Conditional Local Average Treatment Effects\nNote: Estimates of the Local Average Treatment Effects of sharing the credential conditional on the baseline level of employability.\nEstimates from models estimated with data on learners with an increasing baseline employability.\nA8", "Table 9: Covariate balance between treatment and control\nVariable Mean Difference Standard Error Treatment Mean Control Mean Treatment N Control N\nfirst_skill_score_1 3e-04 0.0014 0.1002 0.0999 381815 383801\nfirst_skill_score_3 0 1e-04 0 0 381815 383801\nassociate_degree 3e-04 4e-04 0.029 0.0287 381815 383801\nbachelor_degree -8e-04 8e-04 0.1269 0.1278 381815 383801\nsome_college -5e-04 6e-04 0.0721 0.0726 381815 383801\ndoctorate_degree -2e-04 2e-04 0.0043 0.0045 381815 383801\nhigh_school_diploma -4e-04 5e-04 0.0592 0.0596 381815 383801\nless_than_high_school 0 2e-04 0.0089 0.009 381815 383801\nmasters_degree -7e-04 5e-04 0.0496 0.0503 381815 383801\nno_education_mentioned 0.0022 0.0011 0.6458 0.6436 381815 383801\nprofessional_degree 2e-04 1e-04 0.0041 0.0038 381815 383801\nmale -8e-04 0.001 0.3014 0.3022 381815 383801\ngender_not_mentioned 9e-04 0.0011 0.5336 0.5328 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_computer_science 0.0015 0.001 0.2529 0.2514 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_data_science -0.001 0.001 0.2353 0.2363 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_information_technology -6e-04 8e-04 0.1398 0.1404 381815 383801\ncredential_type_guided_project 1e-04 9e-04 0.1679 0.1678 381815 383801\ncredential_type_professional_certificate -1e-04 2e-04 0.0054 0.0055 381815 383801\ncredential_type_specialization -3e-04 2e-04 0.0084 0.0087 381815 383801\ndeveloping_country 5e-04 7e-04 0.8962 0.8957 381815 383801\nprofessional_exp_years 0.0464 0.0609 3.6122 3.5658 18487 18459\npast_business_job -0.0014 0.0026 0.0641 0.0655 18487 18459\npast_tech_job 0.0034 0.0035 0.1308 0.1274 18487 18459\nNote: Averages of covariate values across treatment and control groups.\nC Impact of Credential Feature on Credential Sharing\nPanel A of Table 10 presents the average treatment effect estimates on credential sharing per batch.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope .

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment.

To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%).

The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

These results indicate a significant impact of the treatment on reporting New Job among treated learners, particularly within the lower deciles.\n\nThe findings from Table 2 also provide evidence for the benefit of Credential Shared, which is estimated to increase the probability of sharing credentials by 24% p.p., as well as an increased likelihood of reporting New Job in Scope among treated individuals. These effects are observed across various groups and highlight a positive impact on new job opportunities for learners with lower baseline employability.\n\nMoreover, Model 3 from Table 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models that account for the group indicators as dependent variables. Among these models, treating learners who added their credential to LinkedIn is found to be more likely to report New Job in Scope, with an increase in the probability of doing so by 10% (S.E. 4%) among treated individuals within Groups 3 and 4.\n\nThe Local Average Treatment Effects (LATE) reported in Table 3 suggest that Credential Feature has a particularly pronounced effect on New Job among treated learners, increasing the probability of reporting New Job by 12% p.p.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups.

Estimates based on the LinkedIn\nMatched Sample.\nE Local average treatment effect across deciles\nTo analyze the impact of Credential Shared across various levels of employability as predicted by our\nmodels, we predict baseline employability using a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with cross-\nfitting on a LinkedIn Matched Sample. The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "The study suggests that prioritizing access to the Credential Feature for learners with lower baseline employability can be advantageous because it is associated with better outcomes among this group.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all. Hadavand et al. (2018) compared outcomes of completers to non-completers of a large\n4", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "1 Introduction\nIn today\u2019s educational landscape, non-traditional credentials, frequently acquired through online courses,\nhave become increasingly popular. In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"], "response": "Based on the provided context information, the research suggests that MOOC credentials can have a positive impact on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes.

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.
