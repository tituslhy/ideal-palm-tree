We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all. Hadavand et al.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job.

Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Rivas, M.

Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization.

In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups).

Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"], "response": "The purpose of the notifications sent to learners was to encourage them to showcase their earned credentials on their LinkedIn profiles by emphasizing that such profiles receive significantly more views\u2014specifically, six times as many.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment. Point estimates are higher when focusing on New Job in\n12", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3"], "response": "The randomization process for learners receiving certificates between September 2022 and March 2023 involved dividing them into monthly batches based on their graduation dates.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator.

Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

(S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "impact of a more complete LinkedIn profile. To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables.

In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "batch 5, compared to the unrestricted sample.\nTable 10: Average treatment effect of Credential Feature on Credential Shared by Batch\nBatch Mean Control Mean Treatment ATE ATE (%)\nPanel A: LinkedIn Matched Sample\n1 17.832 20.074 2.242 12.571\n(0.617) (0.650) (0.896) (5.025)\n2 14.992 18.255 3.262 21.759\n(0.569) (0.601) (0.828) (5.521)\n3 16.398 19.382 2.984 18.196\n(0.579) (0.627) (0.853) (5.203)\n4 17.533 21.794 4.261 24.303\n(0.616) (0.669) (0.909) (5.185)\n5 16.546 18.123 1.577 9.528\n(0.706) (0.732) (1.017) (6.147)\nPanel B: Sample of learners that logged in after randomization\n1 18.007 20.203 2.195 12.191\n(0.623) (0.655) (0.904) (5.022)\n2 15.259 18.679 3.420 22.410\n(0.579) (0.614) (0.844) (5.531)\n3 16.853 19.917 3.064 18.183\n(0.596) (0.644) (0.877) (5.206)\n4 17.749 22.292 4.543 25.594\n(0.628) (0.686) (0.930) (5.241)\n5 16.829 18.581 1.752 10.411\n(0.724) (0.754) (1.045) (6.211)\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect obtained using a difference-in-means estimator.

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11"], "response": "Based on the data presented in Table 5, the Credential Feature has a positive impact across different tertiles of predicted employability.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge.

Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles.

In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables.

We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group.

(S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Rivas, M.

This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

(2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

Zhenghao et al. (2015), using a survey carried out after course completion, found that a\nsignificant majority of learners report that their MOOC courses helped them achieve career objectives.\nOur work adds to this discussion by investigating the impact of MOOC credentials on actual labor\nmarket outcomes, particularly in the context of developing countries and learners without college\ndegrees.\nA related research agenda studies employers\u2019 perception of MOOC credentials. Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al. (2014), surveying 103 human resources professionals, found that\nwhile MOOCs were viewed favorably on a resume, they were perceived as less likely to demonstrate\nspecific skills than traditional credentials. Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al. (2000), and Hussey (2012). Our research adds\nto this body of work by examining the career outcomes of learners who add MOOC certificates to\ntheir professional profiles, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of\nonline education in the modern labor market.\nFinally, our study aligns with research on the value of signaling capability through non-traditional\ncredentials. Pallais (2014) examined the value of signals in the form of educational credentials and\nwork history on online freelancing platforms, while K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta (2019) explored the impact\nof self-certification and client reviews on freelancers\u2019 success.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization.

Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch.

Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables.

The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"], "response": "The purpose of the notifications sent to learners was to encourage them to showcase their earned credentials on their LinkedIn profiles by emphasizing that such profiles receive significantly more views\u2014specifically, six times as many.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender. The response to the study is voluntary; thus, we do not\n8", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "are followed for longer than the later cohorts, with the first batch being followed for 12 months and\nthe last one for 8. We notice that each batch followed a similar trend in reporting new jobs, with\napproximately 10% of learners reporting a new job after six months. In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job. Solid lines\ntreatment groups. Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job. We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization. Models\n4, 5, and 6 restrict attention to jobs with a starting date at least 4 months after the randomization.\nModels 1 and 4 consider New Job outcome, and all other models New Job in Scope. Models 3 and 6 are\nbased on the subsample of LinkedIn Matched Sample of learners whose previous job was not in scope.\nAll models are adjusted for learners\u2019 covariates.\nWe estimate a statistically significant difference in the probability of reporting a new job between\ntreatment and control in all specifications. Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment. Point estimates are higher when focusing on New Job in\n12", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7"], "response": "The primary outcome of interest, \"New Job,\" refers to any job reported by individuals after completing their course that started at least one month post-randomization.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page.

We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "are followed for longer than the later cohorts, with the first batch being followed for 12 months and\nthe last one for 8. We notice that each batch followed a similar trend in reporting new jobs, with\napproximately 10% of learners reporting a new job after six months. In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job. Solid lines\ntreatment groups. Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job. We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization. Models\n4, 5, and 6 restrict attention to jobs with a starting date at least 4 months after the randomization.\nModels 1 and 4 consider New Job outcome, and all other models New Job in Scope. Models 3 and 6 are\nbased on the subsample of LinkedIn Matched Sample of learners whose previous job was not in scope.\nAll models are adjusted for learners\u2019 covariates.\nWe estimate a statistically significant difference in the probability of reporting a new job between\ntreatment and control in all specifications. Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment. Point estimates are higher when focusing on New Job in\n12", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\nVariable name Mean S.E.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "The primary outcome of interest is \"New Job,\" which refers to positions reported on LinkedIn profiles starting at least one month after randomization.

Re-\nsults show no significant differences between treatment and control groups.\nA4", "Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\nVariable name Mean S.E.

We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

We find that controlling for the interaction term, the treatment is statistically\ninsignificant and the interaction term is statistically different from zero for Group 2 and Group 4. This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization.

When we additionally restrict\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\nafter the randomization.\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics. We then apply this model to par-\n13", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

Our analysis aims to de-\ntermine whether our intervention and credential sharing more broadly increase or reduce disparities\nin outcomes.\nTable 5: Effect of Credential Intervention and Credential Sharing on Employment by Tertile\nof Predicted Employability\nImpact of Credential Feature: Proportional Hazard Model Impact of credential sharing: Instrumental Variable Model\nHigh Employ.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11"], "response": "Based on the analysis presented in Table 5, the impact of the Credential Feature on new job attainment varies across different tertiles (levels) of predicted baseline employability. The estimates for the high, medium, and low employability groups are 0.382 pp, 0.671 pp, and 1.265 pp, respectively, indicating that the effect increases as the level of employability decreases. Among these, only the low employability group shows a statistically significant effect, with a p-value less than 0.05 given the standard threshold for significance (the confidence interval does not cross zero).

Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Table 3: Impact of Credential Feature on combined Credential Shareed and New Job indicators\nModel 1 Model 2\nNew Job No new job New Job New Job No new job New Job\nNo certificate Certificate Certificate No certificate Certificate Certificate\nCredential Feature 0.034 0.050 0.116 \u22120.071 \u22120.002 \u22120.035\n(0.041) (0.027) (0.034) (0.053) (0.038) (0.044)\nLow employability \u22121.113 \u22120.513 \u22121.245\n(0.063) (0.039) (0.054)\nCredential Feature * Low employability 0.266 0.098 0.415\n(0.087) (0.054) (0.073)\nBaseline 0.0696 0.193 0.103 0.0696 0.193 0.103\n(0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022) (0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nNote: Multinomial logistic regression with outcome variable equal to the group indicator.

When we additionally restrict\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\nafter the randomization.\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics.

However, for learners in the lower tertile (with lower baseline employability), there is a statistically significant effect of 1.265 percentage points (S.E. 0.529). This indicates that the Credential Feature has a more substantial positive impact on individuals with lower predicted employability, potentially aiding those who are more disadvantaged in terms of employment opportunities.", "passing": true, "feedback": "YES", "score": 1.0, "pairwise_source": null, "invalid_result": false, "invalid_reason": null}, {"query": "**Question:** Based on the findings presented, how does the Credential Feature impact learners with different baseline employability levels, and what implications does this have for prioritizing access to the feature?", "contexts": ["effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all. Hadavand et al. (2018) compared outcomes of completers to non-completers of a large\n4", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 3: Impact of Credential Feature on combined Credential Shareed and New Job indicators\nModel 1 Model 2\nNew Job No new job New Job New Job No new job New Job\nNo certificate Certificate Certificate No certificate Certificate Certificate\nCredential Feature 0.034 0.050 0.116 \u22120.071 \u22120.002 \u22120.035\n(0.041) (0.027) (0.034) (0.053) (0.038) (0.044)\nLow employability \u22121.113 \u22120.513 \u22121.245\n(0.063) (0.039) (0.054)\nCredential Feature * Low employability 0.266 0.098 0.415\n(0.087) (0.054) (0.073)\nBaseline 0.0696 0.193 0.103 0.0696 0.193 0.103\n(0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022) (0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nNote: Multinomial logistic regression with outcome variable equal to the group indicator.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope .

To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn.

Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners.

Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings.

Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "data science specialization and estimates a salary increase and a higher likelihood of job mobility for\ncompleters.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "K\u00e4ssi, O. and Lehdonvirta, V .

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

Zhenghao et al. (2015), using a survey carried out after course completion, found that a\nsignificant majority of learners report that their MOOC courses helped them achieve career objectives.\nOur work adds to this discussion by investigating the impact of MOOC credentials on actual labor\nmarket outcomes, particularly in the context of developing countries and learners without college\ndegrees.\nA related research agenda studies employers\u2019 perception of MOOC credentials. Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al. (2014), surveying 103 human resources professionals, found that\nwhile MOOCs were viewed favorably on a resume, they were perceived as less likely to demonstrate\nspecific skills than traditional credentials. Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al. (2000), and Hussey (2012). Our research adds\nto this body of work by examining the career outcomes of learners who add MOOC certificates to\ntheir professional profiles, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of\nonline education in the modern labor market.\nFinally, our study aligns with research on the value of signaling capability through non-traditional\ncredentials. Pallais (2014) examined the value of signals in the form of educational credentials and\nwork history on online freelancing platforms, while K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta (2019) explored the impact\nof self-certification and client reviews on freelancers\u2019 success. Abebe et al. (2020) evaluated the effects\nof a job application workshop that provides certificates in various skills, leading to improvements\nin employment and a significant increase in earnings. Carranza et al. (2020) found that certificates\nimproved job search outcomes and increased callbacks from firms. Athey and Palikot (2022) reported\nhigh impacts of a program focused on developing portfolios that helped women signal technical skills\nin their search for technology jobs.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al.

Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

The experimental\npopulation consisted of 880,000 learners, with 37% in Business, 25% in Computer Science, 24% in\nData Science, and 14% in Information Technology. The credentials were issued from 7,355 unique\ncourses, ranging from shorter formats such as Courses (82%) and Guided Projects (16%) to longer\nones such as Specializations (1.6%) and Professional Certificates (1%).\n7", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

The experimental\npopulation consisted of 880,000 learners, with 37% in Business, 25% in Computer Science, 24% in\nData Science, and 14% in Information Technology.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Career Outcome Determination : Based on the computed time difference, we categorized the\ncareer outcomes as follows:\nA2", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "impact of a more complete LinkedIn profile. To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn. Columns 1 and 3 have all LinkedIn\nviews as outcomes, and Columns 2 and 4 restrict attention to views not by the user. Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3"], "response": "The \"Current Enrollment in Educational Program\" feature is a binary indicator set to TRUE if the end date of the participant\u2019s educational program is later than 2022.

If the result is negative,\nindicating that the participant has not yet graduated, the value is set to 0.\nAdditionally, to discern career outcomes from the LinkedIn scraped data, the following method-\nology was applied:\n1. Internship Identification : Initially, we extracted the current job position from the profile to\nascertain whether the term \u201cIntern\u201d was present, which would indicate an internship role.\n2. Time Difference Calculation : Subsequently, we calculated the time difference in months be-\ntween the start date of the most recent experience and September 2022, when our experiment\nstarted.\n3. Career Outcome Determination : Based on the computed time difference, we categorized the\ncareer outcomes as follows:\nA2", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "The career development would be classified as a new internship since the current job title includes \"Intern\" and the employer has remained the same as the previous job.

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job.

Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page.

(S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

Re-\nsults show no significant differences between treatment and control groups.\nA4", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications.

Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification.

The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

Our analysis aims to de-\ntermine whether our intervention and credential sharing more broadly increase or reduce disparities\nin outcomes.\nTable 5: Effect of Credential Intervention and Credential Sharing on Employment by Tertile\nof Predicted Employability\nImpact of Credential Feature: Proportional Hazard Model Impact of credential sharing: Instrumental Variable Model\nHigh Employ.

The first three\ncolumns show the estimate from the proportional hazard model of the average treatment effect of the Credential Feature. Standard errors\nare in parentheses.\nThe results of this analysis are presented in Table 5. The baseline probability of reporting employ-\nment is 32% for the upper tertile, 12% for the middle tertile, and 11% for the lower tertile. The first\nthree columns of the table show the estimates from the Cox proportional hazard model of the impact\nof Credential Feature on New Job. For the upper and middle tertiles, the effects are statistically insignifi-\ncant, with estimates of 0.382 p.p. (S.E. 1.141) and 0.671 p.p. (S.E. 0.640), respectively. However, for the\nbottom tertile, we find a statistically significant effect of 1.265 p.p. (S.E. 0.529). When comparing the\n15", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "Based on Table 10 described in the context, the batch that showed the highest average treatment effect (ATE) percentage for the credential feature on credentials shared in Panel A is the second batch.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs.

We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "impact of a more complete LinkedIn profile. To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn. Columns 1 and 3 have all LinkedIn\nviews as outcomes, and Columns 2 and 4 restrict attention to views not by the user. Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3"], "response": "Based on the data presented in Table 11, there is a positive correlation between obtaining a new job and the number of views on LinkedIn.

For the upper and middle tertiles, the effects are statistically insignifi-\ncant, with estimates of 0.382 p.p. (S.E. 1.141) and 0.671 p.p. (S.E. 0.640), respectively. However, for the\nbottom tertile, we find a statistically significant effect of 1.265 p.p. (S.E. 0.529). When comparing the\n15", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches.

In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates.

This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners.

This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings.

The intervention aimed at simplifying and promoting the sharing of these credentials on LinkedIn.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%).

The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups).

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability.

Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6"], "response": "The primary focus of the randomized experiment conducted in the context of Coursera was to investigate whether displaying a credential obtained from a MOOC on professional networking sites like LinkedIn enhances learners' prospects of securing new jobs. The study centered on two main outcomes: reporting new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) and adding the MOOC credential to their LinkedIn profile (Credential Shared). An enhanced feature called Credential Feature was introduced, which facilitated easier sharing of Coursera credentials on LinkedIn profiles along with notifications encouraging this action.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all. Hadavand et al. (2018) compared outcomes of completers to non-completers of a large\n4", "1 Introduction\nIn today\u2019s educational landscape, non-traditional credentials, frequently acquired through online courses,\nhave become increasingly popular. In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Rivas, M.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature.

Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"], "response": "The purpose of the notifications sent to learners was to encourage them to showcase their earned credentials on their LinkedIn profiles by emphasizing that such profiles receive significantly more views\u2014specifically, six times as many.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "click the \u201cShare now\u201d button in the first notification, they received a second notification during their\nsubsequent visit to the app, stating: \u201cLooking to boost your career?

Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "are followed for longer than the later cohorts, with the first batch being followed for 12 months and\nthe last one for 8.

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "impact of a more complete LinkedIn profile. To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page.

Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "batch 5, compared to the unrestricted sample.\nTable 10: Average treatment effect of Credential Feature on Credential Shared by Batch\nBatch Mean Control Mean Treatment ATE ATE (%)\nPanel A: LinkedIn Matched Sample\n1 17.832 20.074 2.242 12.571\n(0.617) (0.650) (0.896) (5.025)\n2 14.992 18.255 3.262 21.759\n(0.569) (0.601) (0.828) (5.521)\n3 16.398 19.382 2.984 18.196\n(0.579) (0.627) (0.853) (5.203)\n4 17.533 21.794 4.261 24.303\n(0.616) (0.669) (0.909) (5.185)\n5 16.546 18.123 1.577 9.528\n(0.706) (0.732) (1.017) (6.147)\nPanel B: Sample of learners that logged in after randomization\n1 18.007 20.203 2.195 12.191\n(0.623) (0.655) (0.904) (5.022)\n2 15.259 18.679 3.420 22.410\n(0.579) (0.614) (0.844) (5.531)\n3 16.853 19.917 3.064 18.183\n(0.596) (0.644) (0.877) (5.206)\n4 17.749 22.292 4.543 25.594\n(0.628) (0.686) (0.930) (5.241)\n5 16.829 18.581 1.752 10.411\n(0.724) (0.754) (1.045) (6.211)\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect obtained using a difference-in-means estimator.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11"], "response": "Based on the data presented in Table 5, the Credential Feature has a positive impact across different tertiles of predicted employability.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

We find that controlling for the interaction term, the treatment is statistically\ninsignificant and the interaction term is statistically different from zero for Group 2 and Group 4. This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability.

Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge.

Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles.

In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables.

We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group.

(S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups.

In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "Rivas, M.

This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

(2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

Zhenghao et al. (2015), using a survey carried out after course completion, found that a\nsignificant majority of learners report that their MOOC courses helped them achieve career objectives.\nOur work adds to this discussion by investigating the impact of MOOC credentials on actual labor\nmarket outcomes, particularly in the context of developing countries and learners without college\ndegrees.\nA related research agenda studies employers\u2019 perception of MOOC credentials. Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al. (2014), surveying 103 human resources professionals, found that\nwhile MOOCs were viewed favorably on a resume, they were perceived as less likely to demonstrate\nspecific skills than traditional credentials. Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al. (2000), and Hussey (2012). Our research adds\nto this body of work by examining the career outcomes of learners who add MOOC certificates to\ntheir professional profiles, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of\nonline education in the modern labor market.\nFinally, our study aligns with research on the value of signaling capability through non-traditional\ncredentials. Pallais (2014) examined the value of signals in the form of educational credentials and\nwork history on online freelancing platforms, while K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta (2019) explored the impact\nof self-certification and client reviews on freelancers\u2019 success.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization.

Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch.

Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables.

The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"], "response": "The purpose of the notifications sent to learners was to encourage them to showcase their earned credentials on their LinkedIn profiles by emphasizing that such profiles receive significantly more views\u2014specifically, six times as many.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender. The response to the study is voluntary; thus, we do not\n8", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. In such cases, treated learners would encounter the notification during their subsequent\nvisit to the Coursera app. Panel B of Table 10 illustrates the average treatment effect on credential\nsharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization (the restriction is applied to\nboth treatment and control groups). We observe a higher treatment effect across all batches, including\nA5", "are followed for longer than the later cohorts, with the first batch being followed for 12 months and\nthe last one for 8. We notice that each batch followed a similar trend in reporting new jobs, with\napproximately 10% of learners reporting a new job after six months. In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job. Solid lines\ntreatment groups. Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job. We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization. Models\n4, 5, and 6 restrict attention to jobs with a starting date at least 4 months after the randomization.\nModels 1 and 4 consider New Job outcome, and all other models New Job in Scope. Models 3 and 6 are\nbased on the subsample of LinkedIn Matched Sample of learners whose previous job was not in scope.\nAll models are adjusted for learners\u2019 covariates.\nWe estimate a statistically significant difference in the probability of reporting a new job between\ntreatment and control in all specifications. Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment. Point estimates are higher when focusing on New Job in\n12", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7"], "response": "The primary outcome of interest, \"New Job,\" refers to any job reported by individuals after completing their course that started at least one month post-randomization.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs.

As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page.

We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "are followed for longer than the later cohorts, with the first batch being followed for 12 months and\nthe last one for 8. We notice that each batch followed a similar trend in reporting new jobs, with\napproximately 10% of learners reporting a new job after six months. In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job. Solid lines\ntreatment groups. Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job. We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization. Models\n4, 5, and 6 restrict attention to jobs with a starting date at least 4 months after the randomization.\nModels 1 and 4 consider New Job outcome, and all other models New Job in Scope. Models 3 and 6 are\nbased on the subsample of LinkedIn Matched Sample of learners whose previous job was not in scope.\nAll models are adjusted for learners\u2019 covariates.\nWe estimate a statistically significant difference in the probability of reporting a new job between\ntreatment and control in all specifications. Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment. Point estimates are higher when focusing on New Job in\n12", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\nVariable name Mean S.E.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "The primary outcome of interest is \"New Job,\" which refers to positions reported on LinkedIn profiles starting at least one month after randomization.

Re-\nsults show no significant differences between treatment and control groups.\nA4", "Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\nVariable name Mean S.E.

We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

We find that controlling for the interaction term, the treatment is statistically\ninsignificant and the interaction term is statistically different from zero for Group 2 and Group 4. This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope . Results are\npresented in Table 4.\nColumns 1 and 2 of Table 4 show estimates from the first-stage regression. We find that treatment\nincreases the probability of sharing credentials by 2.8 p.p. (S.E. 0.4 p.p.), which corresponds to a\n17% increase from baseline. The remaining columns present estimates from the instrumental variable\nregression with New Job and New Job in Scope as outcomes. In Columns 6, 7, and 8, we restrict attention\nto jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after treatment. We estimate positive and\nstatistically significant effects. Specifically, we estimate the local average treatment effect of 0.24 (S.E.\n0.13) for any new job starting at least one month after treatment and 0.36 (S.E. 0.12) when restricting\n14", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization.

When we additionally restrict\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\nafter the randomization.\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics. We then apply this model to par-\n13", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

Our analysis aims to de-\ntermine whether our intervention and credential sharing more broadly increase or reduce disparities\nin outcomes.\nTable 5: Effect of Credential Intervention and Credential Sharing on Employment by Tertile\nof Predicted Employability\nImpact of Credential Feature: Proportional Hazard Model Impact of credential sharing: Instrumental Variable Model\nHigh Employ.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11"], "response": "Based on the analysis presented in Table 5, the impact of the Credential Feature on new job attainment varies across different tertiles (levels) of predicted baseline employability. The estimates for the high, medium, and low employability groups are 0.382 pp, 0.671 pp, and 1.265 pp, respectively, indicating that the effect increases as the level of employability decreases. Among these, only the low employability group shows a statistically significant effect, with a p-value less than 0.05 given the standard threshold for significance (the confidence interval does not cross zero).

Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Table 3: Impact of Credential Feature on combined Credential Shareed and New Job indicators\nModel 1 Model 2\nNew Job No new job New Job New Job No new job New Job\nNo certificate Certificate Certificate No certificate Certificate Certificate\nCredential Feature 0.034 0.050 0.116 \u22120.071 \u22120.002 \u22120.035\n(0.041) (0.027) (0.034) (0.053) (0.038) (0.044)\nLow employability \u22121.113 \u22120.513 \u22121.245\n(0.063) (0.039) (0.054)\nCredential Feature * Low employability 0.266 0.098 0.415\n(0.087) (0.054) (0.073)\nBaseline 0.0696 0.193 0.103 0.0696 0.193 0.103\n(0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022) (0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nNote: Multinomial logistic regression with outcome variable equal to the group indicator.

When we additionally restrict\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\nafter the randomization.\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics.

However, for learners in the lower tertile (with lower baseline employability), there is a statistically significant effect of 1.265 percentage points (S.E. 0.529). This indicates that the Credential Feature has a more substantial positive impact on individuals with lower predicted employability, potentially aiding those who are more disadvantaged in terms of employment opportunities.", "passing": true, "feedback": "YES", "score": 1.0, "pairwise_source": null, "invalid_result": false, "invalid_reason": null}, {"query": "**Question:** Based on the findings presented, how does the Credential Feature impact learners with different baseline employability levels, and what implications does this have for prioritizing access to the feature?", "contexts": ["effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all. Hadavand et al. (2018) compared outcomes of completers to non-completers of a large\n4", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "Table 3: Impact of Credential Feature on combined Credential Shareed and New Job indicators\nModel 1 Model 2\nNew Job No new job New Job New Job No new job New Job\nNo certificate Certificate Certificate No certificate Certificate Certificate\nCredential Feature 0.034 0.050 0.116 \u22120.071 \u22120.002 \u22120.035\n(0.041) (0.027) (0.034) (0.053) (0.038) (0.044)\nLow employability \u22121.113 \u22120.513 \u22121.245\n(0.063) (0.039) (0.054)\nCredential Feature * Low employability 0.266 0.098 0.415\n(0.087) (0.054) (0.073)\nBaseline 0.0696 0.193 0.103 0.0696 0.193 0.103\n(0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022) (0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nNote: Multinomial logistic regression with outcome variable equal to the group indicator.

This\nresult suggests that the effect of Credential Feature is present amongst the learners with low baseline\nemployability (we analyze this further in Section 4.3).\n4.2 The impact of Credential Sharedon the probability of reporting a new job\nThe results presented in Tables 2 correspond to the average increase in the probability of reporting a\nnew job among all treated learners. Now, we estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect ofCredential\nShared treatment. In the first stage, we consider the impact of theCredential Featureon Credential Shared,\nand in the second stage, the impact of Credential Shared on New Job and New Job in Scope .

To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002).

In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn.

Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners.

Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings.

Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "data science specialization and estimates a salary increase and a higher likelihood of job mobility for\ncompleters.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

In 2021, more than 40 million learners signed up for a Massive\nOpen Online Course (MOOC) (Shah, 2021). Many learners gain these credentials with the intention\nof signaling specific skills to potential employers (Laryea et al., 2021). Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2", "K\u00e4ssi, O. and Lehdonvirta, V .

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

Zhenghao et al. (2015), using a survey carried out after course completion, found that a\nsignificant majority of learners report that their MOOC courses helped them achieve career objectives.\nOur work adds to this discussion by investigating the impact of MOOC credentials on actual labor\nmarket outcomes, particularly in the context of developing countries and learners without college\ndegrees.\nA related research agenda studies employers\u2019 perception of MOOC credentials. Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al. (2014), surveying 103 human resources professionals, found that\nwhile MOOCs were viewed favorably on a resume, they were perceived as less likely to demonstrate\nspecific skills than traditional credentials. Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al. (2000), and Hussey (2012). Our research adds\nto this body of work by examining the career outcomes of learners who add MOOC certificates to\ntheir professional profiles, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of\nonline education in the modern labor market.\nFinally, our study aligns with research on the value of signaling capability through non-traditional\ncredentials. Pallais (2014) examined the value of signals in the form of educational credentials and\nwork history on online freelancing platforms, while K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta (2019) explored the impact\nof self-certification and client reviews on freelancers\u2019 success. Abebe et al. (2020) evaluated the effects\nof a job application workshop that provides certificates in various skills, leading to improvements\nin employment and a significant increase in earnings. Carranza et al. (2020) found that certificates\nimproved job search outcomes and increased callbacks from firms. Athey and Palikot (2022) reported\nhigh impacts of a program focused on developing portfolios that helped women signal technical skills\nin their search for technology jobs.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n6", "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al.

Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

The experimental\npopulation consisted of 880,000 learners, with 37% in Business, 25% in Computer Science, 24% in\nData Science, and 14% in Information Technology. The credentials were issued from 7,355 unique\ncourses, ranging from shorter formats such as Courses (82%) and Guided Projects (16%) to longer\nones such as Specializations (1.6%) and Professional Certificates (1%).\n7", "ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\nin the context of MOOCs.\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

The experimental\npopulation consisted of 880,000 learners, with 37% in Business, 25% in Computer Science, 24% in\nData Science, and 14% in Information Technology.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Career Outcome Determination : Based on the computed time difference, we categorized the\ncareer outcomes as follows:\nA2", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "impact of a more complete LinkedIn profile. To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn. Columns 1 and 3 have all LinkedIn\nviews as outcomes, and Columns 2 and 4 restrict attention to views not by the user. Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3"], "response": "The \"Current Enrollment in Educational Program\" feature is a binary indicator set to TRUE if the end date of the participant\u2019s educational program is later than 2022.

If the result is negative,\nindicating that the participant has not yet graduated, the value is set to 0.\nAdditionally, to discern career outcomes from the LinkedIn scraped data, the following method-\nology was applied:\n1. Internship Identification : Initially, we extracted the current job position from the profile to\nascertain whether the term \u201cIntern\u201d was present, which would indicate an internship role.\n2. Time Difference Calculation : Subsequently, we calculated the time difference in months be-\ntween the start date of the most recent experience and September 2022, when our experiment\nstarted.\n3. Career Outcome Determination : Based on the computed time difference, we categorized the\ncareer outcomes as follows:\nA2", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\nCox Prop.

(S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "The career development would be classified as a new internship since the current job title includes \"Intern\" and the employer has remained the same as the previous job.

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job.

Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page.

(S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

Re-\nsults show no significant differences between treatment and control groups.\nA4", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications.

Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification.

The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

Our analysis aims to de-\ntermine whether our intervention and credential sharing more broadly increase or reduce disparities\nin outcomes.\nTable 5: Effect of Credential Intervention and Credential Sharing on Employment by Tertile\nof Predicted Employability\nImpact of Credential Feature: Proportional Hazard Model Impact of credential sharing: Instrumental Variable Model\nHigh Employ.

The first three\ncolumns show the estimate from the proportional hazard model of the average treatment effect of the Credential Feature. Standard errors\nare in parentheses.\nThe results of this analysis are presented in Table 5. The baseline probability of reporting employ-\nment is 32% for the upper tertile, 12% for the middle tertile, and 11% for the lower tertile. The first\nthree columns of the table show the estimates from the Cox proportional hazard model of the impact\nof Credential Feature on New Job. For the upper and middle tertiles, the effects are statistically insignifi-\ncant, with estimates of 0.382 p.p. (S.E. 1.141) and 0.671 p.p. (S.E. 0.640), respectively. However, for the\nbottom tertile, we find a statistically significant effect of 1.265 p.p. (S.E. 0.529). When comparing the\n15", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16"], "response": "Based on Table 10 described in the context, the batch that showed the highest average treatment effect (ATE) percentage for the credential feature on credentials shared in Panel A is the second batch.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs.

We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7", "observe these characteristics for some learners.\nThe second source of data is the LinkedIn Matched Sample. Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E. 0.002)\n3Additionally, a robustness check restricts our analysis to positions starting four months or more after randomization.\n4Credentials are identified by their unique ID, provided by Coursera and displayed next to the credential\u2019s name on\nLinkedIn profiles.\n9", "and less likely to be from a developing country (the difference is -0.048 p.p. with S.E. 0.002). Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11", "impact of a more complete LinkedIn profile. To test for this mechanism, we compute the number of\ncharacters in the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile, excluding fields related to credentials and new jobs. We\nfind that, on average, learners in the treated group have 1362 characters, and learners in the control\ngroup have 1356. The effect of treatment on this outcome is, therefore, 6 characters (S.E. 6). Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed. In this analysis, we consider the entire experimental group, which includes\nlearners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, all of whom have LinkedIn accounts, and other learners, in-\ncluding those who might not have LinkedIn accounts. In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn. Columns 1 and 3 have all LinkedIn\nviews as outcomes, and Columns 2 and 4 restrict attention to views not by the user. Estimates in Columns 1 and 2 are from the OLS\nestimator, and in Columns 3 and 4, they are with logit regression. Each estimate is adjusted using learners\u2019 characteristics as controls.\nWe estimate that Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the\ncertificate by 0.7 p.p. (S.E. 0.1 p.p.) to 0.3 p.p. (SE 0.1 p.p.) corresponding to a 4% to 2% increase from\nthe baseline levels.\n17", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3"], "response": "Based on the data presented in Table 11, there is a positive correlation between obtaining a new job and the number of views on LinkedIn.

For the upper and middle tertiles, the effects are statistically insignifi-\ncant, with estimates of 0.382 p.p. (S.E. 1.141) and 0.671 p.p. (S.E. 0.640), respectively. However, for the\nbottom tertile, we find a statistically significant effect of 1.265 p.p. (S.E. 0.529). When comparing the\n15", "effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16", "We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches.

In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11"], "response": "Figure 3 shows the Conditional Local Average Treatment Effects for sharing credentials, with these effects being contingent upon varying levels of initial employability.
