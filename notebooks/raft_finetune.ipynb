We conducted a random-\\\\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\\\\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\\\\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\\\\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\\\\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\\\\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\\\\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\\\\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\\\\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\\\\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\\\\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\\\\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\\\\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\\\\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\\\\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\\\\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\\\\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. \",\"Despite their prevalence, there\\\\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\\\\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\\\\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\\\\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\\\\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\\\\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\\\\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\\\\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\\\\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\\\\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\\\\n2\"]],\"title\":[[\"placeholder_title\",\"placeholder_title\",\"placeholder_title\"]]},\"oracle_context\":\"The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\\\\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\\\\nMay 2, 2024\\\\nAbstract\\\\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\\\\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\\\\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\\\\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\\\\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\\\\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\\\\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\\\\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\\\\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\\\\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\\\\n2<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\nHow many learners participated in the study?\"}\\n{\"id\":\"seed_task_1\",\"type\":\"general\",\"question\":\"What platforms were used to deliver the courses?\",\"context\":{\"sentences\":[[\"The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\\\\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\\\\nMay 2, 2024\\\\nAbstract\\\\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\\\\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms.

One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\\\\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\\\\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\\\\ncates.

For the upper and middle tertiles, the effects are statistically insignifi-\\\\ncant, with estimates of 0.382 p.p. (S.E. \",\"Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019).

Our analysis aims to de-\\\\ntermine whether our intervention and credential sharing more broadly increase or reduce disparities\\\\nin outcomes.\\\\nTable 5: Effect of Credential Intervention and Credential Sharing on Employment by Tertile\\\\nof Predicted Employability\\\\nImpact of Credential Feature: Proportional Hazard Model Impact of credential sharing: Instrumental Variable Model\\\\nHigh Employ.

The baseline probability of reporting employ-\\\\nment is 32% for the upper tertile, 12% for the middle tertile, and 11% for the lower tertile. The first\\\\nthree columns of the table show the estimates from the Cox proportional hazard model of the impact\\\\nof Credential Feature on New Job. For the upper and middle tertiles, the effects are statistically insignifi-\\\\ncant, with estimates of 0.382 p.p. (S.E. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\nWhere was the research subject to review and approval?\"}\\n{\"id\":\"seed_task_9\",\"type\":\"general\",\"question\":\"When was the document versioned?\",\"context\":{\"sentences\":[[\"We thank Keshav Agrawal and Elena\\\\nPittarokoili for excellent research assistance.

Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\\\\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\\\\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\\\\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\\\\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\\\\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\\\\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\\\\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\\\\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\\\\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\\\\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>1 Introduction\\\\nIn today\\\\u2019s educational landscape, non-traditional credentials, frequently acquired through online courses,\\\\nhave become increasingly popular.

In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\\\\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\\\\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\\\\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\\\\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\\\\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\\\\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\\\\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\\\\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\\\\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\\\\u2014a combination of en-\\\\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\\\\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\\\\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\\\\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\\\\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\\\\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\\\\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\\\\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\\\\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\\\\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\\\\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\\\\n11<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Despite their prevalence, there\\\\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\\\\nket.

Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates.

Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\\\\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\\\\nand Business.\\\\n3.1 Randomized experiment\\\\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\\\\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\\\\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\\\\u2019s first visit to the\\\\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \\\\u201c Do you want to boost your career?\\\\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. \",\"than learners with high baseline employability.

The first notification was sent on the learner\\\\u2019s first visit to the\\\\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \\\\u201c Do you want to boost your career?\\\\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\\\\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\\\\u201d2 If the learner did not\\\\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\\\\nnot part of this study.\\\\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\\\\n<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\\\\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\\\\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\\\\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\\\\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\\\\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\\\\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\\\\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\\\\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\\\\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\\\\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\\\\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\\\\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\\\\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\\\\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\\\\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\\\\nobserved employment outcomes.\\\\n2 Literature review\\\\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\\\\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\\\\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\\\\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\\\\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\\\\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\\\\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\\\\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\\\\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\\\\n2\",\"data science specialization and estimates a salary increase and a higher likelihood of job mobility for\\\\ncompleters.

However, MOOCs can positively impact career outcomes and employer interest in certain contexts.\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>Despite their prevalence, there\\\\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\\\\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\\\\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\\\\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\\\\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\\\\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\\\\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\\\\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\\\\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\\\\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\\\\n2<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>data science specialization and estimates a salary increase and a higher likelihood of job mobility for\\\\ncompleters.

Piopiunik et al. \",\"ature is the focus on the value of signals across various levels of employability and skills, particularly\\\\nin the context of MOOCs.\\\\n3 Empirical setting and randomized experiment\\\\nCoursera, one of the largest online platforms hosting MOOCs, is characterized by its extensive course\\\\nofferings and partnerships with global universities and organizations (Coursera, Inc., 2023). In 2022, it\\\\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\\\\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates.

We conducted a random-\\\\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\\\\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\\\\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\\\\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\\\\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\\\\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\\\\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\\\\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\\\\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\\\\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\\\\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\\\\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\\\\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\\\\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\\\\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\\\\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\\\\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. \",\"(2021).

We conducted a random-\\\\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\\\\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\\\\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\\\\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\\\\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\\\\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\\\\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\\\\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\\\\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\\\\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\\\\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\\\\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\\\\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\\\\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job.

Adjusted for the characteristics\\\\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\\\\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\\\\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\\\\nobserved employment outcomes.\\\\n2 Literature review\\\\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\\\\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\\\\ntials on learners\\\\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\\\\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\\\\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\\\\nlearners.\\\\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\\\\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\\\\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\\\\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\\\\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\\\\ntials at all. Hadavand et al. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019).

This\\\\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\\\\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\\\\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\\\\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\\\\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\\\\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\\\\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\\\\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\\\\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\\\\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\\\\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\\\\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\\\\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\\\\nplicability of these findings.

The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles.

We\\\\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\\\\naverage treatment effect estimates. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\\\\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nVariable name Mean S.E. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>0.002). Recall\\\\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\\\\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\\\\ntheir gender or level of education.\\\\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\\\\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\\\\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\\\\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\\\\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\\\\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\\\\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\\\\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\\\\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\\\\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\\\\u2014a combination of en-\\\\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\\\\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\\\\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\\\\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\\\\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\\\\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\\\\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\\\\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch.

Re-\\\\nsults show no significant differences between treatment and control groups.\\\\n\",\"Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors.

Without seeing actual variable names from this table directly provided here, we can infer that there are at least a few variables being summarized.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Determine the number of variables**:\\\\n   - Given that no specific numbers or variable names are provided in the context and only an outline is given, it\\'s not possible to accurately count how many variables there are from this information alone.\\\\n   - However, based on typical usage and structure, summary statistics tables usually cover more than one variable.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Conclusion**:\\\\n   - Since we cannot see the actual content of the table beyond its description, we can only say that there are multiple variables being compared in the table.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the limited context provided directly:\\\\n\\\\nANSWER: $multiple\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\\\\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nVariable name Mean S.E. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Table 8: Summary Statistics for Internal Coursera Covariates\\\\nVariable Group Count Min Max Mean SD\\\\ngender unknown 470459 0.00 1.00 0.53 0.50\\\\ngender male 269836 0.00 1.00 0.30 0.46\\\\ngender female 146897 0.00 1.00 0.17 0.37\\\\ngender other 1027 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.03\\\\neducation level unknown 570268 0.00 1.00 0.64 0.48\\\\neducation level associate degree 25298 0.00 1.00 0.03 0.17\\\\neducation level masters degree 44975 0.00 1.00 0.05 0.22\\\\neducation level bachelor degree 114926 0.00 1.00 0.13 0.34\\\\neducation level professional degree 3540 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.06\\\\neducation level college no degree 64078 0.00 1.00 0.07 0.26\\\\neducation level high school diploma 53155 0.00 1.00 0.06 0.24\\\\neducation level doctorate degree 3963 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.07\\\\neducation level less than high school diploma 8016 0.00 1.00 0.01 0.09\\\\nprimary domain business 330462 0.00 1.00 0.37 0.48\\\\nprimary domain data science 208819 0.00 1.00 0.24 0.42\\\\nprimary domain computer science 222335 0.00 1.00 0.25 0.43\\\\nprimary domain information technology 126603 0.00 1.00 0.14 0.35\\\\ncredential type course 727602 0.00 1.00 0.82 0.38\\\\ncredential type guided project 147540 0.00 1.00 0.17 0.37\\\\ncredential type specialization 8278 0.00 1.00 0.01 0.10\\\\ncredential type professional certificate 4799 0.00 1.00 0.01 0.07\\\\ndeveloped country - 888219 0.00 1.00 0.10 0.30\\\\ncertificate has page views - 888219 0.00 1.00 0.20 0.40\\\\ncertificate has page views from linkedin - 888219 0.00 1.00 0.17 0.38\\\\ncount all views - 888219 0.00 726.00 0.71 3.09\\\\ncount all views not by user - 888219 0.00 725.00 0.60 3.03\\\\ncount linkedin views - 888219 0.00 411.00 0.58 2.37\\\\ncount linkedin views not by user - 888219 0.00 411.00 0.49 2.31\\\\nhas degree linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.62 0.48\\\\nhas bachelor linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.43 0.49\\\\nhas master linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.18 0.38\\\\nhas doctor linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.02 0.13\\\\nyearsSinceEnrollment - 20396 0.00 46.00 3.97 5.43\\\\nnew internship linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.05 0.22\\\\nnew job linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.31 0.46\\\\npromotion linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.08 0.27\\\\nnew job or promotion linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.39 0.49\\\\nany outcome linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.44 0.50\\\\nB.1 Balance check analysis\\\\nTable 9 presents a balance check analysis for the total population of the experiment participants. Re-\\\\nsults show no significant differences between treatment and control groups.\\\\n<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019).

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\\\\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\\\\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\\\\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\\\\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\\\\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\\\\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\\\\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\\\\nprofiles\\\\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\\\\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\\\\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\\\\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\\\\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\\\\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\\\\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\\\\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\\\\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\\\\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\\\\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\\\\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\\\\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\\\\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\\\\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\\\\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\\\\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\\\\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\\\\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\\\\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\\\\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\\\\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\\\\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\\\\nprofiles\\\\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\\\\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\\\\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\\\\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\\\\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\\\\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\\\\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\\\\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\\\\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\\\\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\\\\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\\\\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\\\\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\\\\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\\\\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\\\\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\\\\nvalues between the treatment and control groups.

In 2022, it\\\\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\\\\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\\\\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\\\\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\\\\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\\\\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\\\\net al., 2020; Casta\\\\u00f1o-Mu\\\\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\\\\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\\\\nand Business.\\\\n3.1 Randomized experiment\\\\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\\\\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\\\\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\\\\u2019s first visit to the\\\\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \\\\u201c Do you want to boost your career?\\\\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\\\\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\\\\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization. Models\\\\n4, 5, and 6 restrict attention to jobs with a starting date at least 4 months after the randomization.\\\\nModels 1 and 4 consider New Job outcome, and all other models New Job in Scope. Models 3 and 6 are\\\\nbased on the subsample of LinkedIn Matched Sample of learners whose previous job was not in scope.\\\\nAll models are adjusted for learners\\\\u2019 covariates.\\\\nWe estimate a statistically significant difference in the probability of reporting a new job between\\\\ntreatment and control in all specifications. Considering New Job outcome we find a 5.8% (S.E. 2.6%)\\\\nincrease from baseline and 6.8% (S.E. 3.6%) when restricting to employment with a reported starting\\\\ndate at least 4 months after the treatment. Point estimates are higher when focusing on New Job in\\\\n12\",\"13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\\\\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\\\\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\\\\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\\\\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\\\\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\\\\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\\\\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\\\\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\\\\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\\\\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\\\\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

In 2022, it\\\\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\\\\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\\\\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\\\\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\\\\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\\\\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\\\\net al., 2020; Casta\\\\u00f1o-Mu\\\\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\\\\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\\\\nand Business.\\\\n3.1 Randomized experiment\\\\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\\\\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\\\\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

However, this effect is small and less clear-cut than the general advantage of holding a certificate.\\\\n\\\\nANSWER: $Having no certificate has a slight negative impact on new job chances, as suggested by Model 2, but this effect is modest.\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>We also\\\\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course.

We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\\\\ntheir gender or level of education.\\\\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\\\\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\\\\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively.

From a managerial perspective, the\\\\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\\\\u2014a combination of en-\\\\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\\\\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\\\\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\\\\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\\\\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\\\\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\\\\nthe date of randomization.

In 2022, it\\\\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\\\\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\\\\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\\\\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\\\\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\\\\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\\\\net al., 2020; Casta\\\\u00f1o-Mu\\\\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

In 2022, it\\\\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\\\\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\\\\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\\\\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\\\\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\\\\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\\\\net al., 2020; Casta\\\\u00f1o-Mu\\\\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\\\\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\\\\nand Business.\\\\n3.1 Randomized experiment\\\\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\\\\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\\\\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\\\\u2019s first visit to the\\\\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \\\\u201c Do you want to boost your career?\\\\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. \",\"Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\\\\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\\\\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

Given that the estimate is relatively large compared to its standard error and the low value of 0.054% in the ( % ) column, it might suggest a trend but needs more rigorous testing.\\\\n\\\\n### Final Answer:\\\\nANSWER: The effects of the credential feature on middle employability tertiles were not explicitly stated as statistically significant based on the provided context, though they showed some promise with non-zero estimates and relatively low standard errors.\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>Table 4: Local Average Treatment Effects of Credential Sharing: First and Second Stage\\\\nFirst Stage Second Stage Overall Second Stage Exclude 4 monthsCred.

When we additionally restrict\\\\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\\\\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\\\\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\\\\nafter the randomization.\\\\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\\\\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\\\\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\\\\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\\\\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\\\\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\\\\nGroup 4.\\\\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\\\\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\\\\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\\\\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\\\\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\\\\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\\\\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\\\\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\\\\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics.

This suggests a targeted approach to benefit those who need it most.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Pattern of LinkedIn Engagement**:\\\\n   - The Credential Feature encouraged learners to maintain up-to-date LinkedIn profiles.\\\\n   - Two mechanisms were considered to explain potential upward bias in results: \\\\n     1. Learners updating their LinkedIn profiles after finding new jobs but not yet adding them, and\\\\n     2. Increased activity leading to more complete LinkedIn profiles.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: The treatment effect was estimated at 7.1% (SE 3.1%) when considering only jobs starting four months or later post-treatment. This supports the idea that the observed effects are due to the treatment rather than just profile updates from recent job finds.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Conclusion**: Since there were no differences in other services between groups, and given the timing of reported job start dates, it is reasonable to infer that the increased LinkedIn activity was influenced by the Credential Feature.\\\\n\\\\n### Questions Based on Context\\\\n\\\\n1.

For instance, when considering all views (Model 1), ATE is 0.00619 or 3.371% of the baseline, and for views by others (not including the learner themselves - Model 2), it\\'s 0.00246 or 1.8041%.\\\\n6. The estimates are adjusted for learners\\\\u2019 characteristics to ensure a fair comparison.\\\\n\\\\nGiven this information, we can conclude that the Credential Feature has some positive impact on certificate views but the exact magnitude varies depending on the type of view (by others or via LinkedIn).\\\\n\\\\nFinal answer: The Credential Feature increases the probability of having at least one view on the certificate by approximately 0.7 percentage points, with different impacts observed for total views versus views from specific sources.\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>Thus, we\\\\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\\\\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\\\\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\\\\u2019 cer-\\\\ntificates were viewed.

In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\\\\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\\\\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\\\\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\\\\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\\\\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner.

This suggests that there might be a positive impact on job opportunities for students who participate in these courses.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Role of Human Capital and Signaling**: Hussey (2012) discusses two main theories about education: human capital augmentation, which posits that educational attainment directly increases an individual\\'s skills and productivity; and the signaling theory, which suggests that education serves as a signal to employers about a candidate\\'s abilities. MOOCs could contribute to both of these concepts by providing tangible skills (human capital) or serving as credentials (signaling).\\\\n\\\\nCombining these insights, we can infer that MOOC programs might have a positive impact on student employment prospects by enhancing their skills and potentially acting as valuable credentials for employers.\\\\n\\\\n<ANSWER>: The potential impact of MOOC programs on student employment is positive, as they can enhance students\\' skills (human capital) and serve as valuable educational credentials (signaling), thereby improving job prospects.\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>Table 1: Summary statistics pretreatment and outcome variables\\\\nCoursera Internal Data LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nVariable name Mean S.E. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>3.1%) and 11.3% (S.E. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>(2018).

However, without specific details on the findings, we cannot directly conclude from this reference alone.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Hussey (2012)**: This article discusses the value of an MBA in terms of human capital augmentation versus signaling. While it does not specifically address MOOCs, it suggests that educational credentials can have both direct skill-building and signaling benefits for employment prospects.

In 2022, it\\\\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\\\\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\\\\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\\\\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\\\\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\\\\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\\\\u2019s offerings are cen-\\\\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\\\\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\\\\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\\\\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\\\\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\\\\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\\\\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\\\\net al., 2020; Casta\\\\u00f1o-Mu\\\\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\\\\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\\\\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\\\\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\\\\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\\\\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\\\\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\\\\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\\\\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\\\\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\\\\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\\\\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\\\\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\\\\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\\\\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\\\\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\\\\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\\\\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\\\\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\\\\nand skill acquisition.\\\\nReferences\\\\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\\\\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\\\\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\\\\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\\\\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\\\\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\\\\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\\\\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\\\\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\\\\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\\\\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\\\\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\\\\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\\\\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\\\\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\\\\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\\\\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\\\\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\\\\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\\\\nand skill acquisition.\\\\nReferences\\\\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\\\\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\\\\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\\\\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\\\\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\\\\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\\\\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\\\\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\\\\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\\\\n2\",\"Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\\\\nCox Prop.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\\\\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\\\\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\\\\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\\\\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\\\\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\\\\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\\\\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\\\\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\\\\n2<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Table 2: Effect of Credential Feature on New Job and New Job in Scope\\\\nCox Prop.

When we additionally restrict\\\\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\\\\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\\\\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\\\\nafter the randomization.\\\\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\\\\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\\\\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\\\\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\\\\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\\\\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\\\\nGroup 4.\\\\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\\\\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\\\\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\\\\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\\\\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\\\\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\\\\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\\\\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\\\\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics. We then apply this model to par-\\\\n13\",\"0.002). Recall\\\\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\\\\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\\\\ntheir gender or level of education.\\\\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\\\\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\\\\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\\\\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\\\\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\\\\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\\\\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\\\\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\\\\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\\\\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\\\\u2014a combination of en-\\\\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\\\\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\\\\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\\\\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\\\\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\\\\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\\\\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\\\\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\\\\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\\\\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\\\\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\\\\n11\"]],\"title\":[[\"placeholder_title\",\"placeholder_title\",\"placeholder_title\"]]},\"oracle_context\":\"Appendix\\\\nA Sample of courses included in the experiment\\\\nIn Table 7, we show a sample of 50 courses of 7355 from which the learners included in the experiment\\\\ngraduated.\\\\nTable 7: Sample of course included in the experiment\\\\nPrimary domain Credential Type Certificate Name\\\\nInformation Technology Course Fundamentos do Suporte T\\\\u00e9cnico\\\\nBusiness Guided Project Develop a Company Website with Wix\\\\nData Science Course SQL for Data Science\\\\nInformation Technology Course Fundamentals of Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\\\nData Science Course Neural Networks and Deep Learning\\\\nInformation Technology Course Introduction to Cloud Computing\\\\nInformation Technology Course AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials\\\\nBusiness Course Capital-investissement et capital-risque\\\\nData Science Specialization Introduction to Data Science\\\\nBusiness Course Teamwork Skills: Communicating Effectively in Groups\\\\nInformation Technology Course Crash Course on Python\\\\nBusiness Course Excel Skills for Business: Advanced\\\\nData Science Guided Project Introduction to Business Analysis Using Spreadsheets: Basics\\\\nBusiness Course Foundations of Project Management\\\\nBusiness Course Assess for Success: Marketing Analytics and Measurement\\\\nBusiness Course Bookkeeping Basics\\\\nComputer Science Course Introduction to Front-End Development\\\\nBusiness Guided Project Create a Project Charter with Google Docs\\\\nData Science Professional Certificate Google Data Analytics\\\\nInformation Technology Course Technical Support Fundamentals\\\\nComputer Science Course Python Programming: A Concise Introduction\\\\nInformation Technology Course Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript\\\\nComputer Science Guided Project Get Started with Figma\\\\nComputer Science Course Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design\\\\nComputer Science Course Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)\\\\nData Science Professional Certificate IBM Data Analyst\\\\nComputer Science Course JavaScript Basics\\\\nBusiness Course Foundations of Digital Marketing and E-commerce\\\\nData Science Course Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere\\\\nInformation Technology Course AWS Cloud Technical Essentials\\\\nComputer Science Course Blockchain: Foundations and Use Cases\\\\nComputer Science Course HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers\\\\nBusiness Course Developing Innovative Ideas for Product Leaders\\\\nBusiness Guided Project Introduction to Microsoft Excel\\\\nBusiness Course Construction Project Management\\\\nData Science Course Introduction to Genomic Technologies\\\\nInformation Technology Course Explore Core Data Concepts in Microsoft Azure\\\\nComputer Science Course Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\\\\nBusiness Course Esports Teams and Professional Players\\\\nComputer Science Guided Project Build a mobile app with Google Sheets on Glide and no coding\\\\nBusiness Guided Project Designing and Formatting a Presentation in PowerPoint\\\\nNote: A sample of courses in which learners\\\\u2019 included in the experiment graduated from.\\\\n\",\"cot_answer\":\"assistant: Let\\'s break down the process to identify business-related courses from the provided list:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Identify the primary domain** as \\\\\"Business\\\\\" for each course.\\\\n2. **List out all course names that fall under the Business category**.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the context, we can extract the following steps and relevant sentences:\\\\n\\\\n##begin_quote##\\\\nTable 7: Sample of course included in the experiment\\\\nPrimary domain Credential Type Certificate Name\\\\n...\\\\nBusiness Course Capital-investimento e capital-risco\\\\nBusiness Course Teamwork Skills: Communicating Effectively in Groups\\\\nBusiness Course Foundations of Project Management\\\\nBusiness Course Assess for Success: Marketing Analytics and Measurement\\\\nBusiness Course Bookkeeping Basics\\\\nBusiness Course Developing Innovative Ideas for Product Leaders\\\\n##end_quote##\\\\n\\\\nBy following the steps, we can extract the business-related course names as follows:\\\\n\\\\n1.

When we additionally restrict\\\\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\\\\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\\\\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\\\\nafter the randomization.\\\\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\\\\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\\\\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\\\\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\\\\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\\\\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\\\\nGroup 4.\\\\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\\\\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\\\\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\\\\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\\\\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\\\\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\\\\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\\\\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\\\\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics. We then apply this model to par-\\\\n13<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>0.002). Recall\\\\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\\\\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\\\\ntheir gender or level of education.\\\\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\\\\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\\\\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\\\\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\\\\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\\\\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\\\\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\\\\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\\\\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\\\\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\\\\u2014a combination of en-\\\\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\\\\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\\\\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\\\\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\\\\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\\\\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\\\\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\\\\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\\\\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\\\\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\\\\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\\\\n11<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\nCan you list a few business-related course names?\"}\\n{\"id\":\"seed_task_258\",\"type\":\"general\",\"question\":\"What is A1 used to indicate in food products?\",\"context\":{\"sentences\":[[\"\\\\u2013 Otherwise, the outcome is classified as a promotion.\\\\nB Descriptive statistics\\\\nTable 8 presents summary statistics for the covariates provided by the Coursera internal dataset.\\\\nA3\",\"effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p.

In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\\\\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\\\\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\\\\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\\\\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\\\\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\\\\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\\\\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\\\\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\\\\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\\\\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\\\\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\\\\u2014a combination of en-\\\\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\\\\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\\\\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\\\\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\\\\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\\\\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\\\\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\\\\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\\\\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\\\\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\\\\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\\\\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\\\\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\\\\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\\\\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\\\\n11<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\nHow many categories are there for classifying \\\\\"Level of Education\\\\\"\"}\\n{\"id\":\"seed_task_261\",\"type\":\"general\",\"question\":\"Which year\\'s data is primarily used for the \\\\\"University Ranking of the Latest Academic Degree\\\\\" feature?\",\"context\":{\"sentences\":[[\"Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\\\\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action.

In all batches, except for the fifth\\\\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\\\\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\\\\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\\\\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\\\\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\\\\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\\\\nnetworking platform increases learners\\\\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\\\\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\\\\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\\\\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\\\\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\\\\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\\\\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\\\\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\\\\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\\\\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\\\\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\\\\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\\\\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome.

The intervention targeted learners who had\\\\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\\\\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\\\\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\\\\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\\\\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\\\\ncates.

Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. \",\"\\\\u2013 Otherwise, the outcome is classified as a promotion.\\\\nB Descriptive statistics\\\\nTable 8 presents summary statistics for the covariates provided by the Coursera internal dataset.\\\\nA3\",\"Dashed lines control groups.\\\\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\\\\nof reporting a new job. We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\\\\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\\\\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization.

Each\\\\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\\\\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\\\\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\\\\nlearners\\\\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\\\\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\\\\nwithin these strata.\\\\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\\\\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\\\\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\\\\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\\\\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\\\\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\\\\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\\\\n3.2 Data\\\\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\\\\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\\\\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\\\\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\\\\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\\\\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\\\\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\\\\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\\\\nand skills (e.g., \\\\u201cproject management\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cdigital marketing\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cweb development\\\\u201d). In our dataset, we\\\\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\\\\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\\\\u2019 skill level. <\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>\\\\u2013 Otherwise, the outcome is classified as a promotion.\\\\nB Descriptive statistics\\\\nTable 8 presents summary statistics for the covariates provided by the Coursera internal dataset.\\\\nA3<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Dashed lines control groups.\\\\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\\\\nof reporting a new job.

To answer this, let\\'s consider what is known about A4 size:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Identify the standard**: The context provided mentions \\\\\"A4\\\\\", which refers to a standard paper size in the international standard ISO 216.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Understand the relationship between A series sizes**: In the ISO 216 system, each size (A0, A1, A2, ..., A4) is derived from the previous one by halving its area while maintaining the same aspect ratio. The basis of this series is the A0 sheet, which has an area of 1 square meter and a length-to-width ratio of \\\\u221a2.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Determine the dimensions**: Since A4 paper is based on this system, we can use these principles to find its exact dimensions. Specifically:\\\\n   - A4 paper\\'s aspect ratio is such that if you divide the longer side by the shorter side, you get \\\\u221a2.\\\\n   - The area of an A4 sheet is 1\\\\/4th of the area of an A3 sheet, and so on.\\\\n\\\\nGiven these principles:\\\\n\\\\n- ##begin_quote##\\\\n\\\\\"The dimensions of a0 paper are defined as having one side of length exactly 1189 mm (the short side) and its longer side \\\\u221a2 times that length. This relationship holds for all sizes in the series.\\\\\"\\\\n##end_quote##\\\\n\\\\n4. **Calculate the A4 size**: Since each subsequent size is half the area of the previous, we divide the A0 dimensions by two to get A1, then A2, and so on until we reach A4.\\\\n\\\\n- The short side (which corresponds to 841 mm in A0) for A4 would be 297 mm.\\\\n- The long side, being \\\\u221a2 times the short side, would be 420 mm \\\\/ \\\\u221a2 \\\\u2248 297 mm.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, due to rounding and standardization:\\\\n   - The actual dimensions of A4 paper are standardized as 210 mm by 297 mm.\\\\n\\\\nFinal answer: ANSWER: 210 x 297 mm\",\"instruction\":\"<DOCUMENT>A1<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>Accessed:\\\\nNovember 16, 2023.\\\\nTyler, J.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\\\\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\\\\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\\\\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\\\\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\\\\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\\\\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\\\\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\\\\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\\\\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\\\\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\\\\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\\\\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\\\\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\\\\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\\\\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\\\\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\\\\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\\\\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\\\\nand skill acquisition.\\\\nReferences\\\\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\\\\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\\\\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\\\\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\\\\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\\\\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\\\\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\\\\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\\\\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\\\\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\\\\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\\\\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\\\\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\\\\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\\\\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\\\\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\\\\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\\\\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\\\\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\\\\nand skill acquisition.\\\\nReferences\\\\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\\\\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\\\\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\\\\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\\\\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\\\\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\\\\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\\\\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\\\\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\\\\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\\\\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\\\\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\\\\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\\\\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\\\\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\\\\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\\\\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\\\\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\\\\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\\\\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\\\\nand skill acquisition.\\\\nReferences\\\\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\\\\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\\\\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\\\\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\\\\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\\\\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner.

The first notification was sent on the learner\\\\u2019s first visit to the\\\\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \\\\u201c Do you want to boost your career?\\\\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\\\\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\\\\u201d2 If the learner did not\\\\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\\\\nnot part of this study.\\\\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\\\\n<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>4.7%) respectively. When we additionally restrict\\\\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\\\\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\\\\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\\\\nafter the randomization.\\\\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\\\\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\\\\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\\\\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\\\\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\\\\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\\\\nGroup 4.\\\\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\\\\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\\\\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\\\\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\\\\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\\\\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\\\\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\\\\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\\\\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics. We then apply this model to par-\\\\n13<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\n<DOCUMENT>A8<\\\\/DOCUMENT>\\\\nIs A8 a road or highway?\"}\\n{\"id\":\"seed_task_326\",\"type\":\"general\",\"question\":\"Does A8 have any significance in Europe?\",\"context\":{\"sentences\":[[\"Mean S.E.\\\\nTreatment 0.499 0.001 0.500 0.003\\\\nPanel A: Pre-treatment covariates\\\\nProfessional Experience Years \\\\u2013 \\\\u2013 3.040 0.028\\\\nPast Tech Job \\\\u2013 \\\\u2013 0.127 0.002\\\\nPast Managerial Job \\\\u2013 \\\\u2013 0.064 0.001\\\\nMain Skill Absolute 0.099 0.001 2.074 0.010\\\\nMain Skill Standardized 0.000 <0.001 0.000 0.001\\\\nComputer Science 0.252 0.001 0.230 0.002\\\\nData Science 0.236 0.001 0.300 0.002\\\\nInformation Technology 0.140 0.001 0.138 0.002\\\\nGuided Project 0.168 0.001 0.097 0.002\\\\nProfessional Certificate 0.005 <0.001 0.005 <0.001\\\\nSpecialization 0.009 <0.001 0.009 0.001\\\\nDeveloping Country 0.896 0.001 0.850 0.002\\\\nAssociate Degree 0.029 <0.001 0.062 0.001\\\\nBachelor Degree 0.127 0.001 0.367 0.003\\\\nSome College 0.072 0.001 0.130 0.002\\\\nDoctorate Degree 0.004 <0.001 0.012 0.001\\\\nHigh School Diploma 0.059 0.001 0.097 0.002\\\\nLess than High School 0.009 <0.001 0.012 0.001\\\\nMasters Degree 0.050 0.001 0.146 0.002\\\\nNo Education Mentioned 0.645 0.002 0.164 0.002\\\\nProfessional Degree 0.004 <0.001 0.010 0.001\\\\nMale 0.302 0.002 0.674 0.002\\\\nGender Not Mentioned 0.533 0.002 0.101 0.002\\\\nPanel B: Outcome variables\\\\nNew Job \\\\u2013 \\\\u2013 0.177 0.002\\\\nNew Job in Scope \\\\u2013 \\\\u2013 0.133 0.002\\\\nCredential Shared \\\\u2013 \\\\u2013 0.181 0.002\\\\nAll Views 0.191 0.001 0.429 0.003\\\\nAll Views by Others 0.143 0.001 0.318 0.002\\\\nViews LinkedIn 0.165 0.001 0.409 0.003\\\\nViews LinkedIn by Others 0.124 0.001 0.296 0.002\\\\nNote: Professional Experience Years is the number of years between the starting date of the first job and August 2023.
