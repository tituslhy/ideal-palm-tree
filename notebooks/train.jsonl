The study also explored whether light-touch platform policies encouraging such actions can be effective. This was investigated through a randomized experiment conducted within the context of Coursera, where some learners were encouraged to add their newly gained MOOC credentials to their LinkedIn profiles using a Credential Feature."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the treatment affect learners with lower baseline employability in terms of sharing their credentials on LinkedIn?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided context, among learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probability of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared treatments. This suggests that for learners starting with a lower likelihood of securing new employment, the interventions are more effective in increasing their likelihood to share their credentials on LinkedIn."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How were the learners randomized in the experiment, and what factors were used for stratification?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the experiment, learners were randomized into treatment and control groups on a monthly basis from September 2022 to March 2023. Each batch consisted of learners who received their certificates between the first and last day of the respective month, with each batch containing between 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, within these monthly batches, randomization was stratified based on several factors:\n\n- The learners' primary domain\n- Whether they came from a developing country\n- Whether they had a college degree\n\nWithin these strata, each learner had an equal probability of being assigned to either the treatment or control group. This method ensured that the allocation to groups was unbiased and balanced across the different subgroups defined by the stratification factors."}]}

Without considering this interaction term (as in Model 1), the overall impact of the Credential Feature on New Job might be understated, as it does not fully capture how the feature benefits those with lower initial employability.\n\nIn summary, the interaction term between Credential Feature and Low Employability indicates that individuals who are already at a disadvantage regarding employability benefit more significantly from having a credential in terms of securing new job opportunities."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Based on the findings discussed in the document, how might prioritizing access to the Credential Feature benefit learners with low baseline employability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the findings discussed in the document, prioritizing access to the Credential Feature for learners with low baseline employability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners because:\n\n1. **Reducing Disparity in Outcomes**: The impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances of finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.\n2. **Enhancing Employability**: By emphasizing the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles through the Credential Feature, it is plausible that treated learners who found jobs between graduating from the course and receiving treatment might update their LinkedIn profiles due to the nudge. This could potentially increase the visibility of these learners' new job opportunities.\n3. **Increased Engagement and Completeness**: The feature might encourage more active engagement on LinkedIn and more complete profile updates, which can have a positive impact on employability even if immediate employment outcomes are not observed. As mentioned in the document, treated learners could become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete profiles, potentially signaling their skills effectively to potential employers.\n\nThese factors suggest that prioritizing access to the Credential Feature for low-baseline employability learners could help them improve their job prospects by enhancing their online presence and employability signals over time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Credential Feature impact the probability of certificate views from LinkedIn?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Credential Feature appears to have a modest but statistically significant positive effect on the probability that learners' certificates are viewed on LinkedIn. Specifically:\n\n- The average treatment effect (ATE) across all views is an increase of approximately 0.62% (3.371% - 18.84%), corresponding to about a 4% increase from baseline levels.\n- When restricting attention to views by others, the ATE increases slightly to around 1.8%, or roughly a 2% increase from the baseline.\n\nThese effects are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and logistic regression, both adjusted for learners' characteristics. The estimates range between 0.619% and 0.600% across different models, indicating a consistent positive impact.\n\nWhile these increases are relatively small in percentage terms, the results suggest that the Credential Feature can modestly enhance visibility of certificates on LinkedIn, which could be valuable for learners seeking to showcase their achievements online."}]}

This variation affected both the baseline shares of learners sharing their credentials and the average treatment effect estimates.\n\nSpecifically, the second batch had a higher share (96%) of learners logging into the platform compared to the final batch (82%). This difference in engagement could have led to varying degrees of exposure to the notifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing. Consequently, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment effect compared to other batches.\n\nThe varying levels of notification exposure and baseline propensity to respond to treatment can account for these discrepancies. In summary, the notification strategy's effectiveness was somewhat diluted in the final batch due to reduced learner engagement post-randomization, leading to a lower observed treatment effect."}]}
