The study suggests that facilitating credential sharing and emphasizing its value as skill signaling can lead to significant gains in job acquisition."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary focus of the study regarding non-traditional credentials in this paper?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary focus of the study regarding non-traditional credentials in this paper is to investigate whether showcasing a credential acquired from a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on a business networking platform, specifically LinkedIn, increases learners' chances of finding new employment. The research also examines whether light-touch platform policies that encourage the addition of these credentials can be effective.\n\nThe study was conducted through a randomized experiment involving Coursera users who had recently graduated from career-oriented certificate programs and lacked traditional or internationally renowned educational qualifications. A subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature, which facilitated the display of their MOOC credentials on LinkedIn profiles along with targeted notifications encouraging them to do so. The control group did not receive this feature.\n\nThe primary analysis centers on approximately 40,000 subjects who had linked their LinkedIn profile URLs to their Coursera accounts before randomization. It assesses whether these learners reported new employment after being exposed to the Credential Feature, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. Additionally, the study explores the impact of learners sharing their MOOC credentials on their employment outcomes when viewed as an encouragement design."}]}

Specifically:\n\n- Among learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probability of finding a new job had higher treatment effects from both the Credential Feature and the Credential Shared treatments.\n\nThis means that the interventions were more effective in helping learners who started with a lower likelihood of securing new employment. The study suggests that these treatments might help mitigate outcome disparities for less employable learners, which is particularly important given the context of focusing on learners without college degrees and from developing countries who typically face higher baseline employability challenges compared to the general MOOC population."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the Credential Feature affect the probability of certificate views from LinkedIn referrals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Credential Feature has a positive effect on the probability of certificate views from LinkedIn referrals.

The confidence in these estimates is indicated by standard errors, which suggest a relatively low variability.\n\nThus, incorporating the Credential Feature appears to enhance visibility of certificates among LinkedIn users, potentially indicating an increase in engagement or interest when potential employers or peers view profiles with this feature."}]}

The researchers found that having a GED can lead to substantial increases in earnings, indicating that it serves as a signal to employers about the holder's capabilities and educational attainment, even if it is not a traditional degree.

Here's a breakdown of how these factors affected the results:\n\n1. **Baseline Propensity to Respond to Treatment**:\n   - Different batches had varying baselines in terms of their initial inclination or willingness to share credentials after being exposed to the treatment. This baseline propensity can affect how effective the treatment is perceived and acted upon.\n\n2. **Learner Engagement with Notifications**:\n   - The notifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps, but only learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. There was a variation in the percentage of learners logging in after randomization across different batches: \n     - Batch 2 had the highest share (96%) of learners logging in.\n     - The final batch had the lowest share (82%) of learners logging in.\n\n   - Additionally, when Coursera sent additional notifications to learners based on their priority level, it might have influenced when and if treated learners encountered these notifications. In some cases, this could result in treated learners seeing the notification during a subsequent visit to the app after receiving our treatment.\n\n3. **Impact on Treatment Effect Estimates**:\n   - The final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment effect compared to other batches. This suggests that factors such as lower baseline propensity and possibly reduced learner engagement (with 82% logging in) likely contributed to this outcome.\n   - Conversely, the second batch had a higher share of learners logging in post-randomization (96%), which might have resulted in a higher treatment effect.\n\n4. **Table 10 (Panel B)**:\n   - When analyzing the average treatment effect on credential sharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization, we observed a generally higher treatment effect across all batches, including batch A5. This indicates that among those who engaged with the notifications and accessed the platform after randomization, the overall effectiveness of the treatment was more consistent compared to the broader analysis.\n\nIn summary, both the baseline propensity to respond to treatment and learner engagement with the targeted notifications played crucial roles in shaping the average treatment effect estimates across different batches. These factors collectively influenced the observed discrepancies in treatment effects between batches, highlighting the importance of user engagement and initial response rates in such studies."}]}
