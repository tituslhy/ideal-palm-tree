**Question:** What was the observed impact of encouraging learners to share their credentials from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on their job search outcomes?,"[""The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job.

"Answer: Among learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probability of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared. This suggests that the treatments are more beneficial for learners who start with a lower likelihood of securing employment.","[""Within this sample, we estimate that the learners in the treatment group are 6% (S.E. 2%) more\nlikely to report new employment within a year after the treatment, representing a 1 percentage point\n(p.p.) increase from the baseline of 17%. Furthermore, there is a 9% (S.E. 3%) higher likelihood that\nthe treated learners report a new job directly related to the certificate they earned, an increase of 1.2\np.p. (S.E. 0.6 p.p.) from the baseline of 13%. These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p. S.E. 0.4 p.p.) more likely to share their credentials\non LinkedIn.\nCredential Shared, which is the act of sharing the credential on LinkedIn, is another treatment of\ninterest. In this case, the random assignment of the Credential Feature works as an encouragement for\nadding the credential to LinkedIn, and the effect of Credential Feature on New Job is then interpreted as\nthe intent to treat (ITT) for theCredential Shared treatment. The local average treatment effect (LATE) of\nCredential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by\nexposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p. (S.E. 13 p.p.) and 36 p.p. (S.E. 12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables.

The goal was to increase visibility and potentially boost career opportunities for these learners.

For those who received the notifications, the process involved receiving a ""Share now"" button in the first notification. Upon clicking this button, they were directed towards a streamlined process that required only two clicks to add their certificate to their LinkedIn profile. This process significantly reduced the manual steps needed compared to the baseline case where users had to manually copy a link from their credential page and paste it into their LinkedIn profile.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process:
1. **Notification Triggered**: Upon receiving a notification, learners were prompted with a “Share now” button.
2. **Accessing Credentials**: Clicking on ""Share now"" brought them to their credentials page within Coursera.
3. **Streamlined Sharing**: The platform provided an easy-to-use interface that required only two clicks to share the certificate directly from Coursera to LinkedIn.

The notifications also emphasized the benefits of this streamlined process, suggesting that adding a credential via this method could result in six times more views on their LinkedIn profile compared to those who added the link manually.

Estimates based on the LinkedIn\nMatched Sample.\nE Local average treatment effect across deciles\nTo analyze the impact of Credential Shared across various levels of employability as predicted by our\nmodels, we predict baseline employability using a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with cross-\nfitting on a LinkedIn Matched Sample. The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\nA7""]","The analysis indicates that the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) is higher in the two lowest deciles of baseline employability.

"**Question:** Based on the provided context, how does the study suggest that prioritizing access to the Credential Feature for learners with low baseline employability can be advantageous?","[""effects between the bottom and top tertiles, the difference is 0.1 p.p. (S.E. 0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16""]","Based on the provided context, the study suggests that prioritizing access to the Credential Feature for learners with low baseline employability can be advantageous because:

1. **Reduced Disparity in Outcomes**: The findings indicate that the impact of the Credential Feature and shared credentials appears driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances of finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.

2. **Statistical Significance in Lower Tertile**: The heterogeneity in Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates shows that the estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile of baseline employability, suggesting that the feature benefits those who need it most.

3. **Potential for Specific Improvement**: Prioritizing access to the Credential Feature could particularly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes, as credential sharing due to encouragement from this feature can help these learners improve their chances of finding new jobs and enhancing their professional profiles on platforms like LinkedIn.

By focusing on learners with lower initial employability, the strategy aligns with the observed patterns where the intervention shows stronger positive effects in reducing disparities among those who are already at a disadvantage.","{""model_name"":""qwen2.5"",""type"":""ai""}","{""model_name"":""qwen2.5"",""type"":""ai""}"
