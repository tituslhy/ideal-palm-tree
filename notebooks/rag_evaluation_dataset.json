We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job.

Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

The signaling of skills through these credentials is particularly advantageous for these learners, as it enhances their employability more than it does for those with higher baseline employability. Additionally, the study found that the inclusion of these credentials on LinkedIn profiles and the subsequent clicks on them, which redirect to more detailed information about the skills learned, are strongly correlated with new job reporting, indicating increased interest from potential employers.",

At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

                "Randomization was carried out in monthly batches from September 2022 to March 2023. Each\nbatch included learners who received the certificate between the first and last day of the month. The\nsize of the batches varied from 130,000 to 160,000 learners. At the end of each month, the learners in\na given batch were randomized to treatment and control. Randomization was stratified based on the\nlearners\u2019 primary domain, whether they came from a developing country, and whether they had a\ncollege degree. Each learner was randomized to the treatment or control group with equal probability\nwithin these strata.\nLearners who did not launch the Coursera app within 30 days of being assigned to the treatment\ngroup did not receive any notification. However, we continue to consider these users to be part of the\ntreatment group. The percentage of learners who launched the app after graduation varied between\nbatches, with the second batch having the highest percentage (96% of learners) and the fifth batch\nhaving the lowest (82%). Note that the batch is defined on the basis of graduation date rather than\non visit dates to the app. Thus, a learner who graduated in September (the first batch) but visited the\nCoursera app and saw the notification in October is still classified as batch 1.\n3.2 Data\nTo analyze the results of the experiment, we combined data from two sources. The first is the Cours-\nera Internal Data , which includes data that describes user engagement with Coursera apps and user\nregistration surveys. For each learner, we observe the name and dates of granted certificates and the\nlevel of engagement (which may come from potential employers) on the certificate pages, including\nthe number of views (page visits) on the certificate page. Each view is categorized by its origin, in-\ncluding whether or not the view came from LinkedIn (the referral page was LinkedIn) and whether\nthe view came from the associated learner. The last metric is inferred by Coursera from several signals\nand might have both type I and type II errors. Each certificate is associated with a primary domain\nand skills (e.g., \u201cproject management\u201d, \u201cdigital marketing\u201d, \u201cweb development\u201d). In our dataset, we\nobserve 462 different skills. For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. Specifically, we have informa-\ntion about the level of education and gender.

                "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers.

                "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

(2017) discuss the potential of MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) to democratize education by providing broader access to learning opportunities, which can enhance employability for individuals who may not have access to traditional educational pathways.\n\n**Challenges:**\n1. **Stigma and Stereotypes:** Kizilcec, Davis, and Wang (2019) address the stigma and stereotypes associated with online degrees, which can impact how these credentials are perceived by employers and potentially affect the labor market prospects of individuals holding such degrees.\n2. **Ambiguity in Credentials:** Laryea et al. (2021) highlight the ambiguity learners face in using and making sense of MOOCs, suggesting that the non-traditional nature of these credentials can lead to confusion or misinterpretation by employers.\n\nOverall, while online degrees and digital skill certificates offer opportunities for skill development and market entry, they also face challenges related to perception and recognition in the labor market.",
