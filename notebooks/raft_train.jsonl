We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains.

In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Table 9: Covariate balance between treatment and control\nVariable Mean Difference Standard Error Treatment Mean Control Mean Treatment N Control N\nfirst_skill_score_1 3e-04 0.0014 0.1002 0.0999 381815 383801\nfirst_skill_score_3 0 1e-04 0 0 381815 383801\nassociate_degree 3e-04 4e-04 0.029 0.0287 381815 383801\nbachelor_degree -8e-04 8e-04 0.1269 0.1278 381815 383801\nsome_college -5e-04 6e-04 0.0721 0.0726 381815 383801\ndoctorate_degree -2e-04 2e-04 0.0043 0.0045 381815 383801\nhigh_school_diploma -4e-04 5e-04 0.0592 0.0596 381815 383801\nless_than_high_school 0 2e-04 0.0089 0.009 381815 383801\nmasters_degree -7e-04 5e-04 0.0496 0.0503 381815 383801\nno_education_mentioned 0.0022 0.0011 0.6458 0.6436 381815 383801\nprofessional_degree 2e-04 1e-04 0.0041 0.0038 381815 383801\nmale -8e-04 0.001 0.3014 0.3022 381815 383801\ngender_not_mentioned 9e-04 0.0011 0.5336 0.5328 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_computer_science 0.0015 0.001 0.2529 0.2514 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_data_science -0.001 0.001 0.2353 0.2363 381815 383801\nprimary_domain_information_technology -6e-04 8e-04 0.1398 0.1404 381815 383801\ncredential_type_guided_project 1e-04 9e-04 0.1679 0.1678 381815 383801\ncredential_type_professional_certificate -1e-04 2e-04 0.0054 0.0055 381815 383801\ncredential_type_specialization -3e-04 2e-04 0.0084 0.0087 381815 383801\ndeveloping_country 5e-04 7e-04 0.8962 0.8957 381815 383801\nprofessional_exp_years 0.0464 0.0609 3.6122 3.5658 18487 18459\npast_business_job -0.0014 0.0026 0.0641 0.0655 18487 18459\npast_tech_job 0.0034 0.0035 0.1308 0.1274 18487 18459\nNote: Averages of covariate values across treatment and control groups.\nC Impact of Credential Feature on Credential Sharing\nPanel A of Table 10 presents the average treatment effect estimates on credential sharing per batch.

(S.E. ","0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles.

In this context, it is the effect on learners who are induced to share their credentials on LinkedIn due to the Credential Feature.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**: We need to find the specific effect of Credential Shared on New Job within the context provided. This involves looking for any mention of LATE or the effect of sharing credentials on employment outcomes.\n\n3. **Locate the LATE Value**: The context should provide a numerical value for the LATE of Credential Shared on New Job. This is typically expressed in percentage points (p.p.) and may include a standard error (S.E.) to indicate the precision of the estimate.\n\n4. **Extract the Information**: Once the relevant information is identified, it should be extracted and presented clearly.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the context:\n\n- The context discusses various effects related to employment outcomes and the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn.\n  \n- The specific mention of LATE is found towards the end of the context, where it states the effect of Credential Shared on New Job.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThe local average treatment effect (LATE) of Credential Shared on New Job, which is the effect for the type of learner induced to share credentials by exposure to the Credential Feature, is 24 p.p.

(S.E. <\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing.

Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E. <\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>12 p.p.) when considering\nonly jobs directly related to the certificate they earned.\nPrevious literature has documented that participants of MOOCs are predominantly highly edu-\ncated individuals often employed in high-quality jobs, leading to the conclusion that MOOCs can\nexacerbate outcome disparities (Christensen et al., 2013; Zhenghao et al., 2015). Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention.

In all batches, except for the fifth\nbatch, more users in the treatment group reported new jobs than users in the control group. In that\nbatch, there was also a negligible treatment effect on credential sharing (see Appendix C).\nFigure 2: Share of learners reporting new jobs in treatment and control groups\nNote: For each batch, the figure presents the share of learners by treatment and control groups who have reported a new job.

","The value of non-traditional credentials in the labor market*\nSusan Athey & Emil Palikot\nMay 2, 2024\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the labor market value of credentials obtained from Massive Open On-\nline Courses (MOOCs) and shared on business networking platforms. We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. ","For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. <\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>For each learner, Coursera assesses skill mastery and assigns a score (Red-\ndick, 2019). Additionally, we compute a max-mean standardization of the learners\u2019 skill level. We also\nobserve the country where the learner registered for the course. Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. <\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat is the surrogate outcome referred to in the study?"}

We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

This focus is important because it addresses a gap in the literature concerning non-traditional educational credentials and their real-world implications.\n\n2. **Compare with existing literature**: The context mentions several studies that have explored related topics. For example, Rosendale (2016) and Radford et al. (2014) examined employers' perceptions of MOOC credentials, while Kizilcec et al. (2019) discussed the legitimacy of online degrees compared to traditional ones. These studies generally highlight a preference for traditional degrees over MOOCs.\n\n3. **Highlight the study's unique contribution**: The study provides experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC credentials on employer interest and employment outcomes. This is significant because it suggests a shift in employer perceptions towards recognizing the value of MOOC credentials, which contrasts with the general preference for traditional degrees noted in previous studies.\n\n4. **Link to broader literature on signaling**: The study engages with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling, as discussed in works by Spence (1978), Tyler et al. (2000), and Hussey (2012). By examining the career outcomes of learners who add MOOC certificates to their profiles, the study contributes to understanding how online education functions as a signal in the labor market.\n\n5. **Connect to non-traditional credential signaling**: The study aligns with research on signaling through non-traditional credentials, such as Pallais (2014) and K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta (2019), by exploring the value of MOOC credentials in signaling capability and enhancing employment prospects.\n\nBy following these steps, we can see that the study contributes to the literature by providing new insights into the role of MOOC credentials as a form of skill signaling and educational credential signaling, particularly in contexts that have been less explored, such as developing countries and among individuals without traditional college degrees.\n\n<ANSWER>: The study contributes by providing experimental evidence of MOOC credentials' positive impact on employer interest and employment outcomes, enhancing understanding of online education's role in skill signaling and credential signaling, especially in developing countries and for non-degree holders.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Thus, we\ndo not find that the profiles of treated learners are more complete.\n5 Impact of the Credential Featureon Certificate Views\nIn this section, we consider the impact of the Credential Feature on the probability that learners\u2019 cer-\ntificates were viewed.

Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>data science specialization and estimates a salary increase and a higher likelihood of job mobility for\ncompleters. Zhenghao et al. (2015), using a survey carried out after course completion, found that a\nsignificant majority of learners report that their MOOC courses helped them achieve career objectives.\nOur work adds to this discussion by investigating the impact of MOOC credentials on actual labor\nmarket outcomes, particularly in the context of developing countries and learners without college\ndegrees.\nA related research agenda studies employers\u2019 perception of MOOC credentials. Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al. (2014), surveying 103 human resources professionals, found that\nwhile MOOCs were viewed favorably on a resume, they were perceived as less likely to demonstrate\nspecific skills than traditional credentials. Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al. (2000), and Hussey (2012). Our research adds\nto this body of work by examining the career outcomes of learners who add MOOC certificates to\ntheir professional profiles, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of\nonline education in the modern labor market.\nFinally, our study aligns with research on the value of signaling capability through non-traditional\ncredentials. Pallais (2014) examined the value of signals in the form of educational credentials and\nwork history on online freelancing platforms, while K\u00e4ssi and Lehdonvirta (2019) explored the impact\nof self-certification and client reviews on freelancers\u2019 success.

","6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Following the OECD classification,\nwe use this information to group countries into developing and developed. Finally, we also observe\nthe information provided by the learners in their registration survey. <\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>6 Conclusion\nThis study provides insights into the impact of non-traditional credentials, specifically MOOC certifi-\ncates, on labor market outcomes. Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F. <\/DOCUMENT>\nHow many new learners did Coursera add in "}

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2"]],"title":[["placeholder_title","placeholder_title","placeholder_title"]]},"oracle_context":"<0.001), less likely to participate in a Guided Project (the difference is - 0.074 p.p. with S.E.

Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2<\/DOCUMENT>\nHow does participation in a Guided Project change according to the context?"}

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16","Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job. We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models and use censoring\nas defined by the duration between randomization and data collection for each batch. Models 1, 2, and\n3 consider new jobs reported with a starting date at least one month after the randomization. Models\n4, 5, and 6 restrict attention to jobs with a starting date at least 4 months after the randomization.\nModels 1 and 4 consider New Job outcome, and all other models New Job in Scope.

This indicates that the models are focused on analyzing job reporting outcomes.\n\n2. **Look for the Mention of a Specific Model**: We need to find if there is a specific model mentioned that is used across all six models. \n\n3. **Extract Relevant Information**: The context provides the following information:\n   - ##begin_quote## \"We use the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models\" ##end_quote##. This sentence clearly states the model used.\n\n4. **Confirm Consistency Across Models**: The context confirms that the Cox proportional hazard model is consistently used across all six models without any mention of a different model being used for any of them.\n\n5. **Conclude with the Specific Model**: Since the context explicitly states the use of the Cox proportional hazard model in all six models, we can conclude that this is the model used to estimate the average effect of the Credential Feature.\n\n<ANSWER>: Cox proportional hazard model.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job.

These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so. The first notification was sent on the learner\u2019s first visit to the\nCoursera app after the credential was granted, with the message: \u201c Do you want to boost your career?\nOnly [XYZ]% of learners manage to complete [course name] on Coursera and get a certificate. Let everyone\nknow you did it! Add the certificate to your LinkedIn profile in just two clicks .\u201d2 If the learner did not\n1Coursera also offers online degrees with significantly higher costs, but individuals graduating with online degrees are\nnot part of this study.\n2This message included the corresponding course name and the percentage of learners completing it.\n<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Dashed lines control groups.\nIn Table 2, we present the estimates of the average effect of theCredential Feature on the probability\nof reporting a new job.

Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners. Second, we show that learn-\ners who showcased their Coursera certificates on LinkedIn experienced a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of reporting new employment, particularly in roles related to their MOOC credentials. This\neffect was most pronounced among learners with lower baseline employability, suggesting that sig-\nnaling skills through non-traditional credentials can be particularly beneficial for this group and may\ncontribute to more equitable employment outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers.

The classifications are as follows:\n\u2013 Master\u2019s Degree: Identified through keywords such as \u2019master\u2019, \u2019msc\u2019, \u2019maestr\u00eda\u2019, or \u2019ma\u2019.\n\u2013 Bachelor\u2019s Degree: Identified through keywords like \u2019bsc\u2019, \u2019bs\u2019, \u2019bachillerato\u2019, or \u2019bachelor\u2019.\n\u2013 Doctor\u2019s Degree:Identified through keywords such as \u2019doctor\u2019, \u2019doutorado\u2019, or \u2019docteur\u2019.\n\u2013 Degree: This is marked as TRUE if any of the above conditions are satisfied.\n\u2022 University Ranking of the Latest Academic Degree : Utilizing the national rankings provided\nby a public Kaggle dataset (https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets\/mylesoneill\/world-\nuniversity-rankings), we assigned rankings based on the latest available data, predomi-\nnantly from 2015. Note that rankings may vary annually, and institutions may hold different\npositions in different years.\n\u2022 Years Since Latest Academic Degree : This feature calculates the difference in years between\n2023 and the year of the participant\u2019s most recent academic degree. If the result is negative,\nindicating that the participant has not yet graduated, the value is set to 0.\nAdditionally, to discern career outcomes from the LinkedIn scraped data, the following method-\nology was applied:\n1. Internship Identification : Initially, we extracted the current job position from the profile to\nascertain whether the term \u201cIntern\u201d was present, which would indicate an internship role.\n<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Table 3: Impact of Credential Feature on combined Credential Shareed and New Job indicators\nModel 1 Model 2\nNew Job No new job New Job New Job No new job New Job\nNo certificate Certificate Certificate No certificate Certificate Certificate\nCredential Feature 0.034 0.050 0.116 \u22120.071 \u22120.002 \u22120.035\n(0.041) (0.027) (0.034) (0.053) (0.038) (0.044)\nLow employability \u22121.113 \u22120.513 \u22121.245\n(0.063) (0.039) (0.054)\nCredential Feature * Low employability 0.266 0.098 0.415\n(0.087) (0.054) (0.073)\nBaseline 0.0696 0.193 0.103 0.0696 0.193 0.103\n(0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022) (0.0019) (0.0029) (0.0022)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nNote: Multinomial logistic regression with outcome variable equal to the group indicator.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups. Comparing the average covariate values inCoursera\nInternal Data and the LinkedIn Matched Sample, we find that the learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nare more likely to have graduated with a certificate in Data Science (the difference is 0.067 p.p. with\nS.E.

Upon enrolling in the course, learners\nwere asked to provide their LinkedIn profile URLs. In September 2023, we collected LinkedIn profiles\nof approximately 40,000 learners who provided this information. As a result, there was a 12-month\ngap between randomization and LinkedIn data collection for learners in the first batch and an 8-\nmonth gap for those in the last batch. The dataset includes additional information on educational\nbackground, work experience, and LinkedIn activity. Details about the construction of features using\nLinkedIn data are provided in Appendix A.1.\nThe primary outcome of interest is whether learners reported new employment on their LinkedIn\nprofiles\u2014termed New Job. This outcome is observed exclusively within the LinkedIn Matched Sample.\nWe define New Jobs as positions that had a reported starting date at least one month after random-\nization.3 This category includes positions with the same employer. Additionally, to better align with\nthe career aspirations of learners in our sample, we limit our analysis to positions in the technology\nsector or managerial roles. Relevant positions are identified by job titles containing keywords such as\nsoftware, data, and manager. Consequently, New Job in Scope is assigned a value of 1 if the job starts at\nleast one month after the randomization and fits these job title criteria. Moreover, Credential Shared is\nvalued at 1 if the credential appears on the learner\u2019s LinkedIn profile and zero otherwise.4\nFinally, for all learners in Coursera Internal Data, we observe the number of visits to the credential\npage and the referring page. Based on this data, we construct four indicator variables. Specifically,All\nViews takes the value of 1 when the certificate received any view;All Views by Otherstakes the value of\n1 when the certificate page has been viewed at least once by someone other than the learner; andViews\nLinkedIn and Views LinkedIn by Others take the value of 1 for views originating only from LinkedIn by\nanyone or by someone other than the learner, respectively.\nSummary statistics are presented in Table 1, and the balance of covariates between experimental\ngroups is assessed in Appendix B.1. We do not find statistically significant differences in the covariate\nvalues between the treatment and control groups.

Our randomized experiment first shows that features that encourage\nand simplify credential sharing can improve job outcomes for learners.

The findings also highlight the importance of\nthe visibility of credentials on professional networking platforms, as the treatment effect was medi-\nated by the presence of certificates on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles. This underscores the value of online\nplatforms in facilitating skill signaling and enhancing employability.\nFor further research, it would be valuable to explore the longitudinal impact of showcasing MOOC\ncredentials on career advancement and income growth, providing a more comprehensive understand-\ning of their value over time. Investigating employers\u2019 perceptions of non-traditional credentials in\nmore depth, including the factors that influence their recognition and acceptance, would provide valu-\nable insights for both learners and MOOC providers. Furthermore, examining the impact of MOOC\ncredentials in different cultural and economic contexts could shed light on the differences in the ap-\nplicability of these findings. Further research could also assess the extent to which MOOCs contribute\nto skill development and how this relates to employability, exploring the balance between signaling\nand skill acquisition.\nReferences\nAbebe, G., Caria, S., Fafchamps, M., Falco, P ., Franklin, S., Quinn, S., and Shilpi, F.

Zhenghao et al.

Rosendale (2016)\nsurveyed 202 employers about their perceptions of MOOC credentials, showing a general preference\nfor traditional degrees. Radford et al. (2014), surveying 103 human resources professionals, found that\nwhile MOOCs were viewed favorably on a resume, they were perceived as less likely to demonstrate\nspecific skills than traditional credentials. Kizilcec et al. (2019) revealed that respondents believed\nthat online degree programs are less legitimate and respected than conventional degrees. Our study\ncontributes to this literature by providing experimental evidence of the positive impact of MOOC cre-\ndentials on employer interest and real-world employment outcomes, suggesting a positive perception\nof these credentials by employers.\nWe also engage with the broader literature on skill signaling and educational credential signaling,\nas outlined in works such as Spence (1978), Tyler et al.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

Shared\" in the second stage regression when considering new jobs in scope and past not in scope, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section of the context**: The context provides information from Table 4, which includes first and second stage regression results. We need to focus on the second stage regression results that specifically consider \"New Job in Scope & Past Not in Scope.\"\n\n2. **Locate the correct column**: The context mentions several columns with different conditions. We need to find the column that corresponds to \"New Job in Scope & Past Not in Scope.\" According to the context, this is Column 5 for the overall second stage and Column 8 for the second stage excluding 4 months.\n\n3. **Extract the coefficient value**: Once we have identified the correct column, we need to extract the coefficient value for \"Cred. Shared\" from that column. The context provides the coefficient values along with their standard errors.\n\n4. **Verify the correct coefficient**: Ensure that the coefficient value is correctly associated with \"Cred. Shared\" under the specified conditions.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the context:\n\n- The context states: ##begin_quote## \"Columns 3 to 5 consider all jobs. The last three columns restrict attention to jobs reported with a starting date at least 4 months after randomization. Columns 3 and 6 New Job outcome; Columns 4, 5, 7, 8 New Job in Scope.

Shared\" in Column 5 is 0.217, and in Column 8, it is 0.166.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \"Cred. Shared\" when considering new jobs in scope and past not in scope is 0.217 for the overall second stage and 0.166 for the second stage excluding 4 months.\n\n<ANSWER>: 0.217 (overall second stage) and 0.166 (excluding 4 months).","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Accessed:\nNovember 16, 2023.\nLennon, C.

The study uses a two-stage regression approach, with the first stage focusing on credential sharing and the second stage on employment outcomes.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Sections**: The context mentions that the last three columns of Table 4 restrict attention to jobs reported with a starting date at least four months after randomization. This is a key point to focus on.\n\n3. **Purpose of Restriction**: The restriction to jobs starting at least four months after randomization likely serves to ensure that the employment outcomes measured are not immediate or short-term effects but rather reflect more stable, longer-term employment changes. This can help in understanding the sustained impact of credential sharing on employment.\n\n4. **Consideration of Timing**: By focusing on jobs starting four months after randomization, the study can mitigate the influence of short-term fluctuations or temporary job placements that might not accurately reflect the impact of credential sharing.\n\n5. **Quote Relevant Sections**: \n   - ##begin_quote## The last three columns restrict attention to jobs reported with a starting date at least 4 months after randomization. ##end_quote##\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The restriction is likely intended to capture more stable employment outcomes and reduce noise from short-term job changes that might not be directly attributable to the credential sharing intervention.\n\n<ANSWER>: The purpose is to capture more stable, longer-term employment outcomes and reduce noise from short-term job changes.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>(2018).

For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Table 8: Summary Statistics for Internal Coursera Covariates\nVariable Group Count Min Max Mean SD\ngender unknown 470459 0.00 1.00 0.53 0.50\ngender male 269836 0.00 1.00 0.30 0.46\ngender female 146897 0.00 1.00 0.17 0.37\ngender other 1027 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.03\neducation level unknown 570268 0.00 1.00 0.64 0.48\neducation level associate degree 25298 0.00 1.00 0.03 0.17\neducation level masters degree 44975 0.00 1.00 0.05 0.22\neducation level bachelor degree 114926 0.00 1.00 0.13 0.34\neducation level professional degree 3540 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.06\neducation level college no degree 64078 0.00 1.00 0.07 0.26\neducation level high school diploma 53155 0.00 1.00 0.06 0.24\neducation level doctorate degree 3963 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.07\neducation level less than high school diploma 8016 0.00 1.00 0.01 0.09\nprimary domain business 330462 0.00 1.00 0.37 0.48\nprimary domain data science 208819 0.00 1.00 0.24 0.42\nprimary domain computer science 222335 0.00 1.00 0.25 0.43\nprimary domain information technology 126603 0.00 1.00 0.14 0.35\ncredential type course 727602 0.00 1.00 0.82 0.38\ncredential type guided project 147540 0.00 1.00 0.17 0.37\ncredential type specialization 8278 0.00 1.00 0.01 0.10\ncredential type professional certificate 4799 0.00 1.00 0.01 0.07\ndeveloped country - 888219 0.00 1.00 0.10 0.30\ncertificate has page views - 888219 0.00 1.00 0.20 0.40\ncertificate has page views from linkedin - 888219 0.00 1.00 0.17 0.38\ncount all views - 888219 0.00 726.00 0.71 3.09\ncount all views not by user - 888219 0.00 725.00 0.60 3.03\ncount linkedin views - 888219 0.00 411.00 0.58 2.37\ncount linkedin views not by user - 888219 0.00 411.00 0.49 2.31\nhas degree linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.62 0.48\nhas bachelor linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.43 0.49\nhas master linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.18 0.38\nhas doctor linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.02 0.13\nyearsSinceEnrollment - 20396 0.00 46.00 3.97 5.43\nnew internship linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.05 0.22\nnew job linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.31 0.46\npromotion linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.08 0.27\nnew job or promotion linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.39 0.49\nany outcome linkedin - 20396 0.00 1.00 0.44 0.50\nB.1 Balance check analysis\nTable 9 presents a balance check analysis for the total population of the experiment participants.

These results remain robust even when excluding new\njobs reported with a starting date within the first four months after the randomization, which could\npotentially reflect jobs found earlier and reported on LinkedIn due to treatment. Furthermore, this\neffect does not appear to be driven by an increased engagement with LinkedIn, as evidenced by a\ncomparative analysis of the completeness of LinkedIn profiles between groups. Instead, the effect of\nthe treatment appears to be primarily mediated by the presence of credentials in learners\u2019 profiles: we\nestimate that the treatment group is 17% (2.8 p.p.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. <\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat type of credentials were studied in relation to labor market outcomes?"}

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project.

We conducted a random-\nized experiment involving more than 800,000 learners, primarily from developing countries and\nwithout college degrees, who completed technology or business-related courses on the Coursera\nplatform between September 2022 and March 2023. The intervention targeted learners who had\nrecently completed their courses, encouraging them to share their credentials and simplifying the\nsharing process. One year after the intervention, we collected data from LinkedIn profiles of ap-\nproximately 40,000 experimental subjects. We find that the intervention leads to an increase of 17\npercentage points for credential sharing. Further, learners in the treatment group were 6% more\nlikely to report new employment within a year, with an 8% increase in jobs related to their certifi-\ncates. This effect was more pronounced among LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability.\nAcross the entire sample, the treated group received a higher number of certificate views, indicat-\ning an increased interest in their profiles. These results suggest that facilitating credential sharing\nand reminding learners of the value of skill signaling can yield significant gains. When the ex-\nperiment is viewed as an encouragement design for credential sharing, we can estimate the local\naverage treatment effect (LATE) of credential sharing (that is, the impact of credential sharing on\nthe workers induced to share by the intervention) for the outcome of getting a job. The LATE esti-\nmates are imprecise but large in magnitude; they suggest that credential sharing more than doubles\nthe baseline probability of getting a new job in scope for the credential.\n*We thank Eric Karsten and his team in Coursera for collaborating on this project. <\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Athey, S. and Palikot, E.

Human capital augmentation versus the signaling value of mba education. Eco-\nnomics of Education Review, 31(4):442\u2013451.\n19","0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16","4.7%) respectively. When we additionally restrict\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\nafter the randomization.\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group.

The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E. We show that the\ntreatment effect is particularly pronounced in the bottom two deciles.\n16<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>4.7%) respectively. When we additionally restrict\nthe sample to learners whose employment prior to the experiment was not in scope, we find that the\nCredential Feature increases the probably of reporting New Job in Scope with a starting date at least 1\nmonth after the randomization by 10.5% (S.E. 4.2%) and 7.3% (S.E. 4.1%) with jobs starting 4 months\nafter the randomization.\nGroups based on certificate sharing and new employment We classify learners into four groups\nbased on New job and Credential Shared: Group 1 consists of learners who neither added the certificate\nnor reported a new job, Group 2 includes those who did not add the certificate but reported a new\njob, Group 3 comprises learners who added the certificate but did not report a new job, and Group 4\nconsists of learners who both added the certificate and reported a new job. In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables. Model 1 only has the Credential Feature indicator on the left-hand side; it takes the value\nof 1 for learners in the treatment group and 0 for control group learners. We find that among those\ntreated, there are more learners in all groups exceptGroup 1 (reference group, not displayed); however,\nthe difference is particularly pronounced forGroup 4. Model 2 also accounts for the low employability\nindicator and the interaction between treatment and employability. We predict baseline employabil-\nity following the methodology described in Athey et al. (2023). We initially train a Gradient Boosted\nMachine (GBM) model using data from the control group. This model predicts the likelihood of a\nlearner reporting a new job based on pre-treatment characteristics.

We\ncan observe differences in the baseline shares of learners who shared their credentials, as well as in the\naverage treatment effect estimates. Notably, the final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment\neffect compared to other batches. Various factors may contribute to these discrepancies, including\nthe baseline propensity to respond to treatment and the number of learners effectively exposed to the\ntreatment.\nNotifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps,\nhence only those learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. The per-\ncentage of learners who did so varied, with the second batch having the highest share (96%) and the\nfinal batch having the lowest share (82%). Furthermore, in instances where Coursera was sending\nadditional notifications to learners, depending on their priority level, they might be shown before our\nnotifications. <\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat field or discipline does \"Pallais, A.\" pertain to?"}

In Appendix D, we show that there is a high\ncorrelation between certificate views and the probability of reporting a new job; thus, we treat certifi-\ncate views as a proxy for employment outcome.\nTable 6 shows the estimates of the average effect ofCredential Feature on the probability of getting a\nclick on LinkedIn from the OLS estimator. Models 3 and 4 restrict attention to views where the referral\npage was LinkedIn. Models 2 and 4 restrict attention to views by someone other than the learner. All\nestimates are adjusted for learners\u2019 characteristics.\nTable 6: Impact of Credential Feature on the probability of receiving views\nOLS\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\nATE 0.00619 0.00246 0.00600 0.00214\n(0.00090) (0.00080) (0.00085) (0.00075)\nATE % baseline 3.371 1.8041 3.8036 1.8278\n(0.5473) (0.4894) (0.5152) (0.4596)\nBaseline 0.1884 0.1421 0.1621 0.1228\n(0.00063) (0.00056) (0.00059) (0.00053)\nObservations 765,616 765,616 765,616 765,616\nLearners covariates Yes Yes Yes Yes\nNote: Estimates of the average treatment effect on the probability of receiving views from LinkedIn.

If the result is negative,\nindicating that the participant has not yet graduated, the value is set to 0.\nAdditionally, to discern career outcomes from the LinkedIn scraped data, the following method-\nology was applied:\n1. Internship Identification : Initially, we extracted the current job position from the profile to\nascertain whether the term \u201cIntern\u201d was present, which would indicate an internship role.\n","than learners with high baseline employability. This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\nobserved employment outcomes.\n2 Literature review\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\ntials on learners\u2019 employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\nlearners.\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\ntials at all.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021).

In the control group, the\ndistribution of learners is as follows: 63% in Group 1, 7% in Group 2, 19% in Group 3, and 10% in\nGroup 4.\nTable 3 presents estimates of multinomial logistic models with the group indicators as dependent\nvariables.

In 2022, it\nhad over 100 million users, adding more than 21 million new learners during the year (ThinkImpact,\n2021; Learnopoly, 2022; Coursera, 2022). Most courses can be audited for free. Obtaining a certificate\ntypically involves a fee, which varies depending on the course and the institution, and ranges from\n$29 to $99 for individual courses. Specializations and professional certificates, which consist of a series\nof related courses, usually cost between $39 and $79 per month, with the total expense depending on\nthe time taken to complete the series.1 The affordability and flexibility of Coursera\u2019s offerings are cen-\ntral to its appeal, particularly for learners from economically disadvantaged regions or marginalized\ngroups (Kizilcec et al., 2017; Chirikov et al., 2020).\nMany courses offered by Coursera allow learners to obtain completion certificates. In addition to\npaying for them, obtaining certificates typically requires completing coursework and passing assess-\nments. These certificates are often valued for their focus on practical skills relevant to career advance-\nment, and observational data studies and recruited experiments suggest that, indeed, credentials ob-\ntained through such courses can positively impact career progression (Hadavand et al., 2018; Rivas\net al., 2020; Casta\u00f1o-Mu\u00f1oz and Rodrigues, 2021). Many Coursera courses are thus career-oriented,\nand some of the most popular domains include Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science,\nand Business.\n3.1 Randomized experiment\nIn the experiment, the treatment group was randomized to receive access to the Credential Feature, a\nnew feature composed of notifications that encouraged the sharing of credentials on LinkedIn and\nprovided a simplified process to do so.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2","0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>0.06).\nColumns 4 through 6 of Table 5 present the heterogeneity in LATE estimates across tertiles of\nbaseline employability. The estimate is statistically significant only in the lower tertile. Therefore,\nthe impact of both the Credential Feature and Credential Shared observed in the entire experimental\npopulation appears to be driven by improved outcomes among learners with lower baseline chances\nof finding a new job, thus reducing the disparity in outcomes across learners.6\nFirst, these findings suggest that prioritizing access to the feature for learners with low baseline\nemployability may be advantageous when the feature cannot be rolled out to all learners. Second, we\nfind that credential sharing, for example, due to encouragement with Credential Feature, can particu-\nlarly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes.\n4.4 Change in the pattern of LinkedIn engagement\nThe Credential Feature emphasized the importance of having up-to-date LinkedIn profiles. Thus, it is\nnot implausible that the feature drove treated learners to complete their LinkedIn profiles in addition\nto sharing their credentials. We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\nresults.\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\nat least four months after the randomization\u2019s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

Recall\nthat gender and level of education are provided voluntarily through the registration survey, similar to\nthe LinkedIn URLs. We observe that in the LinkedIn Matched Sample, learners are more likely to report\ntheir gender or level of education.\nPanel B of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the outcome variables. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, 18% of the learners found new jobs during the considered period, and 13% of all the learners\nfound jobs that we consider in scope, indicating that most of the new jobs reported were related to\ncertificates. However, most learners did not receive views on their credentials. In theLinkedIn Matched\nSample, these shares were 43% and 30%, respectively. In the Coursera Internal Data , 19% of learners\nreceived any views and only 12% of them received views from others originating from LinkedIn.\nFinally, we find that 18% of learners in the LinkedIn Matched Sample had certificates in their profiles.5\n4 Treatment effects in the LinkedIn Matched Sample\nUsing the randomized experiment, we first explore the effect of the Credential Feature on the average\nrate at which Coursera learners report new jobs, and second, we consider the Local Average Treat-\nment Effect (LATE) (Angrist and Imbens, 1995) of Credential Shared on job outcomes, which is the\neffect on learners who added credentials due to the intervention. From a managerial perspective, the\nevaluation of the Credential Feature yields the overall benefit of the intervention\u2014a combination of en-\ncouragement to share credentials and a streamlined process\u2014to all Coursera learners. This evaluation\nwould be relevant for a cost-benefit analysis of the development of the feature (where, in this case, the\ndevelopment costs of the feature were low). The second analysis is relevant to understanding the\nimpact of showcasing course completion on LinkedIn on the likelihood of securing new employment.\nThis analysis focuses on the outcomes of learners who adhered to the treatment, highlighting the po-\ntential value of adding these credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. Both questions are examined using\nthe LinkedIn Matched Sample.\n4.1 Average Impact of a Credential-Sharing Intervention\nFigure 2 shows the share of subjects per experimental group and batch that reported a new job since\nthe date of randomization. Month 0 corresponds to the month in which the batch was randomized\ninto treatment or control groups, which is a different calendar month for each batch. Earlier batches\n5Note that approximately 10% of learners received views from LinkedIn on their credentials even though they do not\nhave the credentials in their profile. This can happen, for example, when a learner shares the credential as a post in their\nfeed instead of adding it to their profile.\n11<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat type of statistics are provided in Table "}

Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Context**: The context provided is \"A4.\" This could refer to a variety of things, such as a paper size, a road, a type of document, or a model of a product. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine the exact reference.\n\n2. **Assess the Question**: The question states, \"I'm sorry, but I need more context or information to generate questions. Could you please provide a chunk of text or specify a topic?\" This indicates that the question is asking for more information or context to generate further questions.\n\n3. **Determine the Relationship**: The question is essentially a request for more information, and the context \"A4\" is insufficient to fulfill this request. The context does not provide a chunk of text or specify a topic that can be used to generate questions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the context \"A4\" is too vague and the question is asking for more context or information, the logical conclusion is that the question cannot be answered with the given context.

We find that there is a strong correlation between\nreceiving credential views and reporting a new job.\nA6","Despite their prevalence, there\nremains a significant gap in high-quality evidence demonstrating their actual value in the labor mar-\nket. This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization.

This raises important questions: To what extent do these non-traditional credentials help learners\nsecure new employment? Moreover, who benefits the most from them?\nIn this paper, we study whether showcasing a credential acquired from a MOOC on a business\nnetworking platform increases learners\u2019 chances of finding new employment and whether light-touch\nplatform policies encouraging doing that can be effective. In particular, we conducted a randomized\nexperiment in the context of Coursera, a prominent MOOC provider, in which learners were encour-\naged to add their newly gained credentials to their LinkedIn profiles. We focus on a sample of learners\nwho have recently graduated from a career-oriented certificate program and who do not have a college\ndegree or come from a developing country. These learners often lack access to traditional credentials\nor to internationally renowned educational institutions, which makes them more likely to benefit from\nsignaling skills through non-traditional credentials (Hansen and Reich, 2015; Moura et al., 2017).\nA randomly selected subset of these learners received access to the Credential Feature. This feature\nprovided an enhanced process for showcasing Coursera credentials on learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles,\nalong with targeted notifications that encouraged this action. The control group, in contrast, did not\nreceive access to the feature. In our primary analysis, access to Credential Feature is the treatment of\ninterest, and the reporting of new employment on LinkedIn (New Job) is the outcome. Additionally, we\ndefine Credential Shared as the inclusion of the MOOC credential on a LinkedIn profile by the learners.\nCredential Shared is an outcome from the perspective of evaluating the Credential Feature intervention,\nbut when the experiment is viewed as an encouragement design for sharing, we study the impact of\nCredential Shared (now considered as a treatment) on employment outcomes.\nThe primary analysis focuses on the approximately 40,000 subjects who included their LinkedIn\nprofile URLs in their Coursera accounts before randomization. For these learners, we analyze data\nfrom their LinkedIn profiles to assess if they reported new employment after their exposure to the\nCredential Feature, especially in a role related to their MOOC credentials.\n2<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat does Table 11 show estimates of?"}

We need to determine what these treatment effects are focused on.\n\n3. **Understand the Treatment Effects**: The context states:\n   - ##begin_quote## Estimates of the Local Average Treatment Effects of sharing the credential conditional on the baseline level of employability. ##end_quote##\n   - This indicates that the treatment effects are related to the action of \"sharing the credential.\"\n\n4. **Consider the Conditions**: The treatment effects are conditional on a specific factor:\n   - ##begin_quote## conditional on the baseline level of employability. ##end_quote##\n   - This means that the treatment effects are analyzed based on different levels of employability at the baseline.\n\n5. **Summarize the Focus**: Combining these insights, the focus of the treatment effects in Figure 3 is on how sharing the credential impacts individuals, depending on their initial level of employability.\n\n<ANSWER>: The focus is on the effects of sharing the credential, conditional on baseline employability.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Table 11: Correlation between views and new jobs\nDependent variable:\nAll views All views by others Views LinkedIn Views LinkedIn by others\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nNew job 0.513 \u2217\u2217\u2217 0.400\u2217\u2217\u2217 0.497\u2217\u2217\u2217 0.379\u2217\u2217\u2217\n(0.008) (0.007) (0.007) (0.006)\nObservations 36,946 36,946 36,946 36,946\nR2 0.109 0.090 0.107 0.086\nAdjusted R2 0.109 0.090 0.107 0.086\nResidual Std.

Our study focuses on\nlearners without college degrees and those from developing countries. Thus, we focus on learners\nwith lower baseline employability as compared to the general population of learners participating in\nMOOCs. To better understand whether our treatments contribute to or mitigate disparities in out-\ncomes within the population of our interest, we analyze heterogeneity in the effects of both the Cre-\ndential Feature and the Credential Shared with respect to predicted baseline employability. We leverage\ndata on educational and employment backgrounds from learners\u2019 LinkedIn profiles to build a predic-\ntive model for the outcome of finding a job in the absence of the intervention. Our analysis reveals that\namong learners who shared their LinkedIn accounts, those with a lower baseline predicted probabil-\nity of finding a new job have higher treatment effects from the Credential Feature and Credential Shared\n3<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat is the focus of the treatment effects in Figure "}

It could refer to a variety of things such as a model number, a section in a document, a code, or something else entirely.\n\n2. **Assess the sufficiency of the context**: The question itself states that more context or information is needed to generate relevant questions.
