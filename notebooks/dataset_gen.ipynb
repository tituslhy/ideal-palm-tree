This suggests that platform policies that facilitate and\\nencourage the sharing of credentials particularly benefit learners in groups with the lowest chance of\\nreporting new jobs. Furthermore, our results show that signaling skills with non-traditional creden-\\ntials benefits LinkedIn users with lower baseline employability and could be an effective strategy for\\nthese learners to increase their chances of finding new jobs.\\nA secondary analysis relies on surrogate outcomes for the entire experimental population of over\\n800,000 learners. Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\\nobserved employment outcomes.\\n2 Literature review\\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\\ntials on learners’ employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\\nsignaling.

(2015) titled \"Who’s Benefiting from MOOCS, and Why,\" the study explored the benefits of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The authors found that certain groups were more likely to benefit from MOOCs than others. Specifically, participants who had a financial incentive to prove their capabilities or credentials, such as unemployed individuals seeking new job opportunities or low-skilled workers aiming to improve their employability, tended to derive significant value from these courses.\\n\\nThe study suggests that the primary beneficiaries of MOOCs are those who can use them as signals in the labor market. For instance, unemployed professionals might use MOOCs to signal their willingness and capability to learn new skills, thereby making themselves more attractive candidates for job openings. Similarly, low-skilled workers could leverage MOOCs to showcase their potential to employers by demonstrating a commitment to further education and skill development.\\n\\nIn essence, the study highlights that the benefit from MOOCs is more about signaling personal value or potential rather than just acquiring knowledge or skills directly through these courses.', reference_answer_by=CreatedBy(model_name='qwen2.5', type=<CreatedByType.AI: 'ai'>)), LabelledRagDataExample(query='**Answer:** The study by Zhenghao et al.

This difference suggests that not all learners were equally exposed to the treatment notifications due to variations in their login behavior.\\n\\n2. **Impact on Treatment Effect Estimates**: Given that only logged-in learners were targeted by the notifications, the treatment effect estimates would be influenced by the login rates within each batch. The final batch had a notably lower treatment effect compared to other batches, which could partly be attributed to the lower percentage of learners logging into the platform post-randomization.\\n\\n3. **Potential Confounding Factors**: Since additional Coursera notifications might have been shown before our notifications depending on their priority levels, treated learners in some batches may have received these notifications during subsequent visits to the app. This could introduce variability and potentially confound the treatment effect estimates.\\n\\n4. **Restricted Analysis (Panel B of Table 10)**: To address these variations, the analysis was restricted to learners who logged into the app post-randomization. This restriction helped isolate the impact of the specific treatment notifications by excluding those learners who did not log in, thereby providing a clearer picture of the treatment effect on credential sharing among the targeted users.\\n\\nIn summary, the variation in learner login behavior affected treatment effect estimates by altering the exposure to the treatment notifications and potentially introducing confounding factors.

It primarily contributes to research on the per-\\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\\ntials on learners’ employability.

(2015) titled \"Who’s Benefiting from MOOCS, and Why,\" the study explored the benefits of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The authors found that certain groups were more likely to benefit from MOOCs than others. Specifically, participants who had a financial incentive to prove their capabilities or credentials, such as unemployed individuals seeking new job opportunities or low-skilled workers aiming to improve their employability, tended to derive significant value from these courses.\\n\\nThe study suggests that the primary beneficiaries of MOOCs are those who can use them as signals in the labor market. For instance, unemployed professionals might use MOOCs to signal their willingness and capability to learn new skills, thereby making themselves more attractive candidates for job openings. Similarly, low-skilled workers could leverage MOOCs to showcase their potential to employers by demonstrating a commitment to further education and skill development.\\n\\nIn essence, the study highlights that the benefit from MOOCs is more about signaling personal value or potential rather than just acquiring knowledge or skills directly through these courses.', reference_answer_by=CreatedBy(model_name='qwen2.5', type=<CreatedByType.AI: 'ai'>)),\n",

This difference suggests that not all learners were equally exposed to the treatment notifications due to variations in their login behavior.\\n\\n2. **Impact on Treatment Effect Estimates**: Given that only logged-in learners were targeted by the notifications, the treatment effect estimates would be influenced by the login rates within each batch. The final batch had a notably lower treatment effect compared to other batches, which could partly be attributed to the lower percentage of learners logging into the platform post-randomization.\\n\\n3. **Potential Confounding Factors**: Since additional Coursera notifications might have been shown before our notifications depending on their priority levels, treated learners in some batches may have received these notifications during subsequent visits to the app. This could introduce variability and potentially confound the treatment effect estimates.\\n\\n4. **Restricted Analysis (Panel B of Table 10)**: To address these variations, the analysis was restricted to learners who logged into the app post-randomization. This restriction helped isolate the impact of the specific treatment notifications by excluding those learners who did not log in, thereby providing a clearer picture of the treatment effect on credential sharing among the targeted users.\\n\\nIn summary, the variation in learner login behavior affected treatment effect estimates by altering the exposure to the treatment notifications and potentially introducing confounding factors.
