Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13.

Specifically, the differences in outcomes are statistically significant only in the lower tertile of baseline employability, indicating that the feature's benefits are particularly evident for learners who have a harder time finding new jobs. This suggests that prioritizing access to the feature could be advantageous when it cannot be rolled out to all learners, as its impact is driven by improving outcomes among those with lower initial chances of employment.\\n\\nAdditionally, credential sharing, possibly encouraged by the Credential Feature, can particularly benefit learners with low baseline outcomes, reducing disparities in outcomes across learners. The findings also suggest that the Credential Feature may have led treated learners to update their LinkedIn profiles more frequently and comprehensively.

Specifically, the study estimates the financial return to holding a GED certificate by comparing the earnings of individuals with and without this credential, controlling for other factors that might influence earnings such as education level and work experience. The researchers found that having a GED can lead to substantial increases in earnings, indicating that it serves as a signal to employers about the holder\\'s capabilities and educational attainment, even if it is not a traditional degree. This signaling value helps individuals with a GED to be perceived more favorably in the job market relative to those without this credential.', reference_answer_by=CreatedBy(model_name='qwen2.5', type=<CreatedByType.AI: 'ai'>)),\n",

Here's a breakdown of how these factors affected the results:\\n\\n1. **Baseline Propensity to Respond to Treatment**:\\n   - Different batches had varying baselines in terms of their initial inclination or willingness to share credentials after being exposed to the treatment. This baseline propensity can affect how effective the treatment is perceived and acted upon.\\n\\n2. **Learner Engagement with Notifications**:\\n   - The notifications aimed at encouraging credential sharing were displayed within the Coursera apps, but only learners who logged into the platform post-randomization were targeted. There was a variation in the percentage of learners logging in after randomization across different batches: \\n     - Batch 2 had the highest share (96%) of learners logging in.\\n     - The final batch had the lowest share (82%) of learners logging in.\\n\\n   - Additionally, when Coursera sent additional notifications to learners based on their priority level, it might have influenced when and if treated learners encountered these notifications. In some cases, this could result in treated learners seeing the notification during a subsequent visit to the app after receiving our treatment.\\n\\n3. **Impact on Treatment Effect Estimates**:\\n   - The final batch exhibited a significantly lower treatment effect compared to other batches. This suggests that factors such as lower baseline propensity and possibly reduced learner engagement (with 82% logging in) likely contributed to this outcome.\\n   - Conversely, the second batch had a higher share of learners logging in post-randomization (96%), which might have resulted in a higher treatment effect.\\n\\n4. **Table 10 (Panel B)**:\\n   - When analyzing the average treatment effect on credential sharing limited to learners who logged into the app post-randomization, we observed a generally higher treatment effect across all batches, including batch A5. This indicates that among those who engaged with the notifications and accessed the platform after randomization, the overall effectiveness of the treatment was more consistent compared to the broader analysis.\\n\\nIn summary, both the baseline propensity to respond to treatment and learner engagement with the targeted notifications played crucial roles in shaping the average treatment effect estimates across different batches.
