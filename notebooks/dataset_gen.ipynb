Although we do not observe the details of the LinkedIn profiles for most of these\\nlearners, we can still measure whether the learner placed the credential on their profile and received\\na click on it from another LinkedIn user. Clicking on the credential redirects to the certificate page\\non Coursera and reveals more information about it, specifically concerning the skills learned by the\\nindividual. This click may indicate increased interest from potential employers, and we show in the\\nsubsample with employment outcomes that clicks on the certificate are strongly correlated with new\\njob reporting. We refer to this surrogate outcome as Credential View. Adjusted for the characteristics\\nof the learners, we estimate that the assignment of the Credential Feature increases the probability of\\nCredential View by 2% to 4% of the baseline probability of receiving a view, which is about 0.13. This\\nevidence suggests that the impact of the intervention extended beyond the sub-sample where we\\nobserved employment outcomes.\\n2 Literature review\\nThis paper engages with several strands of literature. It primarily contributes to research on the per-\\nception and value of non-traditional credentials among employers and the impact of MOOC creden-\\ntials on learners’ employability. It further connects with literature on skill signaling and credential\\nsignaling. Our study offers evidence from a randomized experiment, isolating the impact of skill\\nsignaling with MOOC credentials and separating it from the skill level or job search motivation of\\nlearners.\\nUsing randomized audit studies (sending fictitious resumes to job openings posted online), Dem-\\ning et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) showed that online degrees have a lower impact on employa-\\nbility than traditional degrees. Rivas et al. (2020), using a recruited experiment where mechanical\\nTurk workers were asked to select among alternative hypothetical worker profiles, demonstrated that\\nMOOC credentials increase the chances of being selected for a job as compared to having no creden-\\ntials at all.

We consider two mechanisms that, if true, would upwardly bias our\\nresults.\\nFirst, treated learners who found a job between graduating from the course and receiving treat-\\nment but have not yet added the new job to their LinkedIn profile might update their profiles due to\\nthe nudge. Thus, the jobs added in the first month or two after treatment reflect the difference in the\\nprobability of having an up-to-date profile rather than getting a new job. In Columns 2 and 3 of Table\\n2, we consider the impact of treatment on the probability of reporting a new job with a start date of\\nat least four months after the randomization’s date (we find qualitatively the same results for 3 and\\n5 months). Taking into account only such jobs, we estimate the treatment effect of 7.1% (SE 3.1%).\\nThere were no differences in reminders or other Coursera services between the treatment and control\\ngroups after the initial treatment. Thus, it is unlikely that at the time of treatment, many learners\\nwould add jobs with a start date four months later. Thus, while we cannot rule out that some learn-\\ners updated their profiles because of the treatment, the difference in the probability of reporting jobs\\nstarting several months after the treatment is suggestive of an impact from the treatment.\\nSecond, treated learners could also become more active on LinkedIn and have more complete\\nprofiles. If that were the case, the treatment effect could combine the effect of signaling skills with the\\n6We analyze the impact of Credential Shared on finer employability groups (deciles) in Appendix E.

The GBM was trained on nine of these folds to predict em-\\nployability scores, which were then utilized to assign each observation into deciles based on predicted\\nemployability levels. Next, we compute indicators of deciles of baseline employability.\\nUsing these declines, we estimate LATE within the groups defined by cumulative deciles (e.g.,\\nthe first model includes only the lowest decile, the second model spans the first and second deciles,\\netc.). Results are presented in Figure 3. Our analysis shows a higher LATE in the two lowest deciles,\\nsuggesting that interventions might be most effective within these groups.\\nA7'], reference_answer='**Answer:** The table demonstrates a significant positive correlation between various types of views and the likelihood of obtaining a new job. Specifically, the coefficient for \"New job\" ranges from 0.379 to 0.513 across four models, with standard errors ranging from 0.006 to 0.008. This indicates strong statistical significance (p<0.01) for all models. The R-squared values range from 0.086 to 0.109, suggesting that a portion of the variance in new job outcomes can be explained by these view counts.\\n\\nAdditionally, the F-statistics are highly significant, further confirming the statistical significance of the relationships observed.
